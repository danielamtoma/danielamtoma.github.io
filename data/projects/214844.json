    "objective": "The proposal is to use our great synthetic control to examine the use of heterometallic cyclic coordination compounds (heterometallic rings, HRs) in two distinct application areas. One is of immediate impact: the use of the HRs as resist materials for lithography. This work has already been patented and is being developed as a means to fabricate devices that will be needed at the 7 nm node and smaller. The synthetic control also means we can make resists for extreme UV lithography (13 nm wavelength) which meet the tight specifications needed for industrial application. The second application is more long term, which is the proposal that such rings could be used as qubits in quantum information processing. Here we will build on recent work that has established a diamagnetic matrix in which complex polymetallic assembly could be incorporated. This gives us the opportunity of performing algorithms during the project and hence laying the ground-work for future developments.",
