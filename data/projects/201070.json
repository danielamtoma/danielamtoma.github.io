    "objective": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia faces high-challenging and timely problems related to the classification and efficient prognosis of patients at the time of diagnosis and the attempt to personalize the treatment. CLLassify addresses these issues in a pioneering fashion within a multidisciplinary collaboration, proposing an improved classification of the patients, based on innovative statistical techniques as well as the novel aspect of personalized prediction of the need for treatment at a specific time point for the individual patient. The statistical background of the applicant, together with the expertise of his supervisor in CLL, guarantee the successful implementation of this project. This will result both in significant health advances and societal benefits for the European society at large raising the project at the level of a European priority, and to significant improvement of the applicant√≠s career prospects within Europe.",
