    "objective": "The proposal involves the development of a productionised version of the Pulse-R multigas engine. Pulse-R is Oaktec's patented technology. Optimised for gas fuels, it represents a step change in the performance of small ICE's. Delivering 15-30%  better fuel economy than diesel and petrol units and up to 40% improvement on current gas alternatives. Targeted at the large but often overlooked static power sector, the engine has huge market potential both within the EU and globally. The project will allow Oaktec to undertake the work necessary to take the current prototype to production and sales. Follow on will be the development of further iterations of the engine optimised and for additional sectors.",
