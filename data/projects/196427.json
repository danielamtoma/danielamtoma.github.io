    "objective": "The objective of MAXITHERM is to contribute to the expansion of Electric mobility by extending Electric Vehicles autonomy. We propose a heating system for EV that reduces electricity demand of heating systems in by 30%  while maitaining passenger comfort. MAXITHERM  is a heating system based on a technical textile composed by a blend of electrically conductive  and non-electrically conductive fibres that is integrated within the structure of the vehicles. It provides direct and fast heat to passangers and is 32% more cost efficient that current solutions.",
