    "objective": "The business of our company is agricultural trading. We realized that our sector lacks a reliable, fast, on-site detection method of Mycotoxins, in particular of deoxynivalenol (DON) in wheat grains, which is one of the major threats to the food and feed sector. We aim to commercialize a Mycotoxin (DON toxin) sensor unit, which is easy to use on-site, provides results with more than 90% accuracy compared to conventional laboratory HPLC method in the whole measurement range, while keeping its selling price low (at 10.000Ã„). Our pilot technological tests and preliminary business planning envisaged a huge business potential of our project. In this phase 1 project, we plan to carry out technological feasibility study, market and risk assessment, freedom to operate study as well as to develop a phase 2 proposal and improve our business plan.",
