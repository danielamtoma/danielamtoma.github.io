    "objective": "Attentional deficits are a frequent consequence of brain damage after stroke. Current treatment approaches using brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are  based on two theoretical constructs, namely (1) inter-hemispheric inhibition within the dorsal attention network and (2) the presence of interactions between the ventral and dorsal attention network and. The proposed projects put these constructs to the test by combining TMS with neuroimaging and, based on these findings, explore novel brain connectivity based TMS treatments. Collectively, these projects advance current neurocognitive models of attentional control and lead to advanced TMS protocols that can alleviate attention deficits in patients.",
