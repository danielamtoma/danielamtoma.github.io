    "objective": "The aim of the present project is the development of a theoretical tool for the description of neutral excitations that are directly probed in absorption, electron energy loss and inelastic X-Ray scattering experiments. It is focused on the description of dynamical effects beyond the quasi particle picture that are not taken into account in the present theories. The final goal will be the correct description of the spectrum in systems where dynamical effects are not negligible as metals and strongly correlated insulators, the description of multiple excitations that are not included in a quasi particle picture and the understanding of the role played by electronic correlations on the lifetime of neutral excitations. Particular attention will be devoted to the problem of the multiple excitations in strongly correlated transition metal oxides.",
