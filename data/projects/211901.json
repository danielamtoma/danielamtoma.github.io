    "objective": "This collaborative doctoral training programme provides a model for the development of technology leaders, enabling them to apply scientific methods from academia to interdisciplinary industrial design. The project is driven by the need for more efficient & lower emission engine systems. Heat exchangers in engines has been identified as a key enabling technology for low-emission power systems that is vital to the EU economy and is of great societal concern. Development of high-performance heat exchangers is a complex engineering challenge requiring academic contributions at the forefront of engineering science, which will enhance the EUÃ­s competitiveness by delivering economically and environmentally improved products. Having identified charge air cooling as a key enabling technology for low-emission power systems, here we propose an integrated approach to doctoral training in the area of engineering design leading to four doctorates covering diverse aspects of their mechanical engineering: structural vibration, stress & thermal analysis, additive manufacturing (AM), multifunctional metamaterials, fatigue & materials development. This project brings together a consortium of industrial and academic partners in a novel and bespoke doctoral training programme that is multi-disciplinary in its content and inter-sectoral with regards to the employability of the technology leaders of tomorrow. The programme provides a coherent training platform that inherently nurtures technical, creative and entrepreneurial skills. The central theme of Engineering Design within the programme enables us to build a training structure which is technically broad yet scientifically rigorous, while having the academic depth expected of a doctoral programme. The programme provides mobility, industrial experience and academic foundations in an integrated manner that will uniquely equip our future technology leaders to contribute to high-value innovation within EU industry.",
