    "endDate": "31/12/2021",
    "objective": "CARTNET trains young researchers in Europe to address serious and global problems of antibiotic resistance. Disease-causing bacteria are becoming resistant even to last resort antibiotics and transmission of resistance genes and resistant pathogens is widespread between human, animal and environmental reservoirs. Therefore, CARTNET will focus on alternative approaches to handle antibiotic resistance and treating resistant infections in both humans and animals. It will provide competences to young researchers and future policymakers that will allow them to use knowledge at all relevant scientific levels and in collaboration with stakeholders in both human and veterinary medicine as well as in chemistry, structural biology and natural product chemistry to develop new antimicrobial solutions. CARTNET comprises researchers who are leading experts on antibiotic resistance and antimicrobial drug discovery. They will in cooperation with the recruited early stage research (ESR) trainees use structural biology to synthesize new antimicrobials, screen environmental microorganisms and microbiota for new active compounds and limit spread of resistance through knowledge of dissemination of mobile genetic elements. The research training is hosted by universities with a strong track record of graduate training and is composed of an ambitious scientific program flanked by essential generic training courses and with ample opportunity for networking at network meetings, conferences and shared secondments. In addition to training young researchers for the challenges of tomorrow CARTNET will from day one provide excellent research with impressive scientific and societal impact.",
