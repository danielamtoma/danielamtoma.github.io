    "objective": "Quantum Computing has been a subject of huge interest in recent years, from researchers and the general public alike, due to its intriguing potential for applications which will forever be beyond the reach of classical computing. Despite recent progress in both experimental and theoretical techniques, difficulties in communicating the needs and results of these respective camps has resulted in a lack of major implementable applications for near-term technologies. This action aims to change the field multilaterally, from developing novel tools to deal with critical practical issues hindering implementation through to a first resource sensitive theoretical approach to finding applications with technological practicalities at its core.",
