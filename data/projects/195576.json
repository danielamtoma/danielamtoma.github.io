    "endDate": "31/03/2017",
    "objective": "Silvercatpharma project aims at developing C-C cross-coupling reactions catalysed by d11-blocks metals, particularly silver, for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals in Novartis. It strives to have an impact in terms of cost, environment and international visibility because of the use of silver as an alternative catalyst. The project offers me a great opportunity to obtain further training, such as clusters preparation, computational and flow chemistry, and to define my final career in academia or industry because of the possibility of working in these two different environments.",
