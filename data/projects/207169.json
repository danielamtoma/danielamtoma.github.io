It makes inspections of critical components more simple, reliable and affordable for both maintenance teams and asset owners. And it enables condition monitoring on even the oldest equipment, without any need for adjustments to the equipment or external wiring.\n\nAiming is developed as an answer to ongoing requests from professionals in industrial maintenance and building management. The product reduces the administrative burden and improves the quality of inspections and maintenance. In that way it allows more safe and longer effective use of installations whilst reducing their footprint.\n\nThe product is based on a proven software platform and uses off the shelf hardware. It has a modular architecture, is fully scalable and is multi-language. With over 430.000 installations waiting for better maintenance and better inspections all over Europe, Aiming has a enormous market potential.",
