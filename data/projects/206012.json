    "objective": "The aim of the project is to collaboratively address a common innovation support challenge; namely to improve the use of public funds for R&D&I enabling synergies between ESIF, H2020 and other funds. Intermediary organizations offering support services on funding opportunities to SMEs are relevant actors in this process from two main points of view: 1) they can help policy makers in the development and application of the synergies, 2) they can support SMEs in the correct use of public funds for R&D. The Peer learning activity will serve to learn from the best and to share good and bad practices in funding opportunities support services. The realized Design Option Paper will serve as a ìguideî or a ìhandbookî to other agencies and business support centres to provide similar and/or more focused services on funding opportunities support.",
