    "objective": "The future of widespread clean energy relies heavily on understanding, developing, and optimizing materials for electrochemical energy storage. To date, a limited understanding of how short-range structures influence macroscopic device properties during operation has hindered implementation of promising technologies such as sodium-ion batteries. Here, we aim to use NMR spectroscopy to provide molecular-level insight into the chemical mechanisms underpinning structural and dynamic changes in novel phosphorus- and phosphide-based anodes and correlate these changes with sodium-ion performance figures or merit, including capacity, retention, charging rates, and lifetime. The impact of anode structure and dynamics on electrochemical properties in batteries will provide insight into new materials that can achieve high performance for electrochemical energy storage.",
