    "objective": "Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health problem with 9 million new TB cases and 1.5 million TB deaths in 2013.\nGiven that with a wide health care access to diagnosis, most deaths are preventable, TB mortality is still unacceptably high.\nWith TOPO-TB the aim is to develop the first rapid diagnostic kit based on detection of the activity of an essential enzyme of the bacteria. A high degree of simplicity and low cost, in combination with mycobacteria detection in non-sputum samples, will enable TOPO-TB to achieve high impact on Tuberculosis control and elimination. Importantly, the low resource adaptable format meets the requirements of highly competitive TB test, complementing state-of-the-art methods for detection at the point of care patient level.",
