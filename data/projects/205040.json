    "objective": "With the market introduction of X-10 Pathology we aim to shape a new era of healthcare and drive clinical testing to play a major role in prevention, diagnosis and disease monitoring. We are targeting a group of inflammatory-related pathologies affecting about 15-20% of the world population, for which no specific diagnostic assay is currently available. We want to stop the spiral of repeated tests and specialist consultations and offer patients a simple and inexpensive test on a powerful device, to have their disease identified and monitored in an accurate and timely fashion. To honour our mission we have developed X-10 Pathology, the first-ever device with demonstrated diagnostic capability on the specific causes of inflammatory conditions. Born from the synergy of cutting edge technical and clinical expertise, our standalone platform aims to provide a simple, cost-effective device that empowers also non-specialized personnel to provide fast and specific answers to patients with a minimally invasive test, also in developing Countries. We believe that the disruptive concept of X-10 Pathology has the enormous potential of empowering the healthcare system in its race to balance limited resources with the need of reliable and cost-effective diagnosis and treatment to a growing and ageing global population. Considering the advanced stage of development of our product and the successful outcome of preliminary clinical tests, we target the launch of X-10 Pathology in 2018, after obtaining regulatory approval. By joining the global market of In Vitro Diagnostics we will contribute to the growth of this sector, expected to reach Ã„ 66 billion by 2020. A feasibility study covering the technological, commercial and financial aspects will enable us to finalize our business plan and secure our steps towards the successful market launch.",
