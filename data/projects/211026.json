    "objective": "Taking inspiration from natural carriers, such as viruses, a new technology has been developed in\nour laboratories part of an ongoing ERC starting grant project, Molecular Engineering of Virus-like\nCarriers (MEViC). We created synthetic viruses using polymers and thus safer materials. They are\nable of delivering high payload of specific drugs into cells with no detrimental effect. While testing for\nanticancer therapies, we identified a synthetic virus capable of targeting almost exclusively\nmacrophages. We performed preliminary work showing that this can be successfully applied to\ndeliver antibiotics to rid of intracellular pathogens. This has now open a completely new possibility\nwhereas we can expand our technology for the treatment of several infections as well as to contribute\nto the ongoing efforts in tackling antibiotic resistance.",
