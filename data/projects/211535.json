    "objective": "'The impact of cybercrime is a growing concern in a society that increasingly interacts online. In the EU the cost of\ncybercrime has reached Ä871 billion a year and fraudulent card transactions amounted to Ä1.27 billion. The high number of\nonline frauds coupled with the low level of cybersecurity deters businesses, and in particular SMEs who may not be able to\nafford comprehensive anti-fraud services, from fully exploiting the potential of e-commerce. UNFRAUD is a software product\nthat prevents potential online fraud scenarios by analysing previous and current fraudulent invents through deep learning\nartificial intelligence to tackle the new challenges that fraudsters devise. UNFRAUDís algorithms are similar to oneís used by\nGoogle for self driving cars and facial recognition (i.e. deep AI that recognizes human errors, behaviours and surroundings)\nand through this deep learning it is able to detect 'fraudulent' behaviour. This makes UNFRAUD much more reliable as well\nas greatly reducing the cost of anti-fraud services, allowing companies to operate and grow safely. During the Phase 1\nfeasibility study the project will focus on identifying and securing the key partners required for commercialisation,\nestablishing a sound business model and commercialization strategy, and planning a pilot test with a bank, big e-commerce,\nenterprise, telecommunication company and public administration in order to fully demonstrate and assess the products\ncapabilities.'",
