    "objective": "AGROVIN will put in the market ULTRAWINE, a low frequency high power (LFHP) ultrasound equipment designed for optimizing the extraction of phenolic compounds from grape skins during the first stages of winemaking. Our proposed innovation allows completing the grape maceration process in 6 hours while current systems take approximately 4 days, with 30 times less energy and the ability to process triple amount of grape. ULTRAWINE renders a high quality must with an intense colour and aroma, setting the adequate basis for an excellent wine.\n\nThe general objective of ULTRAWINE is to put into the market a high performance equipment to assist the extraction of phenolic compounds in the grape peels based on low frequency high power (LFHP) ultrasound technology, in a period of 24 months, with the aim of selling an accumulated amount of 130 units by 2021.",
