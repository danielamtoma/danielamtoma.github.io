    "objective": "Kurata Systems Process represents an alternative production method of high added value fuels from residues such as plastics, used industrial oil and refinery residue. We obtained diesel C and other fuels that meet the legislation specifications. Although we have an adequate quality fuel to introduce into the market, the limitation in our productivity scale keeps off the commercialization of our fuels. Based on our pilot-plant results, the objective of this project is to scale-up a continuous process with three different processing lines for each feedstock (plastic, industrial oil and refinery residue) in a new plant.\n\nThis project involves an alternative source of fuel, reducing energy supply risks with the corresponding dependance of other countries.  Additionally Kurata is involved as a waste management project.",
