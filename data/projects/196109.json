    "objective": "This proposal is an opportunity for a promising academic at the beginning of her career with expertise in user interfaces and user experience to work and train with two internationally recognised centres with expertise in geometric modelling and mass customisation. This collaboration will significantly boost her career progress and will allow her to develop into a mature and professional European Researcher as a leading figure in the subject of mass customisation user experience. It will also establish a long lasting connection between the two Hosts and the Hosts and the Applicant.\n     In mass customisation (MC) creating a satisfying and engaging experience for the consumer is significant, which has been considered as one of the success factors for MC, especially in terms of increasing consumer loyalty. Nevertheless, a number of effort has been made mainly focusing on the technical and business implementation of MC, very little research considers the consumer interaction and consumer experience in MC environment, even though some of them focused on the menu choice design rather than creating an overall experience of interaction, and some of them investigate consumer experience from the manufactureís perspective rather than the consumerís perspective. Given these considerations, this research is designed to identify a framework in terms of positive and negative influences of online MC design on consumer experience; identify strategies for initial functional model for MC design based on previous framework; validate the strategies to further develop the model, and use the model to inform the best practice guidelines to provide the design reference and standards for MC.",
