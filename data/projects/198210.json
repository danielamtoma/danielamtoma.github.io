    "objective": "The CREATIONS coordination action aims to demonstrate innovative approaches and activities that involve teachers and students in Scientific Research through creative ways that are based on Art and focus on the development of effective links and synergies between schools and research infrastructures in order to spark young people√≠s interest in science and in following scientific careers. It aims to support policy development by a) demonstrating effective community building between researchers, teachers and students and empowering the latter to use, share and exploit in an innovative the collective power of unique scientific resources (research facilities, scientific instruments, advanced ICT tools, simulation and visualisation applications and scientific databases) in meaningful educational activities that build on the strengths of formal (educational field trips, virtual visits, school based masterclasses) and informal (games and student generated apps, webfests and hangouts, related artworks like science theatre or student generated exhibits, debates in the framework of junior science cafes) learning, that promote creative inquiry-based learning and appreciation of how science works, b) demonstrating effective integration of science education with infrastructures through monitored-for-impact innovative activities, which will provide feedback for the take-up of such interventions at large scale in Europe and c) documenting the whole process through the development of a roadmap that will include guidelines for the design and implementation of  innovative educational and outreach activities that could act as a reference to be adapted for stakeholders in both scientific research outreach and science education policy.",
