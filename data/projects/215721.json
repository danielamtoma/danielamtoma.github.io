    "objective": "Adachis pioneering report in 2012 describing TADF emitters based on CDCBs resulted in a paradigm shift in emitter design within the OLED community. Within just five years, highly efficient blue and green purely organic TADF OLEDs have been developed, achieving maximum EQEs exceeding 30%. This means that performance wise, organic TADF emitters have already surpassed the performance of state-of-the-art phosphorescent molecules. However, to date only a handful of red organic TADF emitters exist, with the best EQE reported to date being just 13%, demonstrating a need for continued improvement. European companies such as CDT, Merck, and Cynora are all investing significantly in organic TADF research. The development of high performance organic redTADF emitters will significantly reduce the cost of OLED production and make the devices more environmentally friendly through replacement of the iridium emitters that are currently employed. We propose to develop new highly efficient redTADF dyes based on the ring-contracted systems of subphthalocyanine and subporphyrin.",
