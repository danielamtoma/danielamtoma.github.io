    "objective": "AEGIS, brings together the data, the network & the technologies to create a curated, semantically enhanced, interlinked & multilingual repository for public & personal safety-related big data. It delivers a data-driven innovation that expands over multiple business sectors & takes into consideration structured, unstructured & multilingual datasets, rejuvenates existing models and facilitates organisations in the Public Safety & Personal Security linked sectors to provide better & personalised services to their users. AEGIS will introduce new business models through the breed of an open ecosystem of innovation & data sharing principles. From the technology perspective, AEGIS targets to revolutionise semantic technologies in big data, big data analytics & visualisations as well as security & privacy frameworks by addressing current challenges & requirements of cross-domain & multilingual applications. The main benefits derived from AEGIS to data identification, collection, harmonisation, storage & utilisation towards value generation for these sectors will be: Unified representation of knowledge; Accelerated, more effective & value-packed cycles of intelligence extraction & of services & applications development; Introduction of novel business models for the data sharing economy & establishment of AEGIS as a prominent big data hub, utilising cryptocurrency algorithms to validate transactions & handle effectively IPRs, data quality & data privacy issues though a business brokerage framework. Based on an early market analysis, the Total Addressable Market of AEGIS is up to $31bn (Ã„27.1bn); AEGIS is able not only to capture a portion of the market size, but also to expand the pie through creating additional uncaptured value based on small data integration in typical big data repositories & algorithms. Based on the same analysis, the project will break even & will be viable from its launch (2020) & will have a ROI investment of EU-commission in the first years.",
