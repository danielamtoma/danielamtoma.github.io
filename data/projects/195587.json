    "objective": "Graphene ñ a single layer of carbon atoms ñ exhibits a unique combination of superior properties, which makes it a credible starting point for new disruptive technologies in a wide range of fields. However, the absence of an energy gap in its electronic band structure prevents at present its integration in digital logic devices. This research project will tackle the challenge by incorporating nanometer-size boron nitride or boron carbon nitride barriers in graphene domains. These lateral hetero-structures will be used as channel elements in field-effect transistors, whose electron transport properties will be evaluated by a combination of high- and low-temperature electrical measurements. The synthesis of the hetero-structures will be extensively investigated through optical, electronic, probe microscopy and spectroscopy analyses. This approach is designed to take a holistic view of the synthesis process, not only hunting for the highest apparent quality of the grown nano-structures, but also gaining an understanding of the underlying atomistic growth mechanism, so as to enble engineering of these structures.The project will advance European scientific competitiveness in the field of synthesis of 2D hetero-structures, currently a prerogative of a select few US groups, and will provide new platforms which might represent a viable option to obtain graphene-based transistors suitable for digital logic.The multidisciplinary aspect of the project will allow me as experienced researcher to gather knowledge in topics as different as synthesis of nanomaterials, electronic device manufacturing, and low-temperature electrical characterization. It will also allow me to re-integrate the European scientific network, after my postdoc experience in the US, forming a perfect basis of my goal of establishing an independent research group in a European university.",
