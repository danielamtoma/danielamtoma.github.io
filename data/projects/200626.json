    "startDate": "01/03/2016",
    "endDate": "31/05/2016",
    "objective": "PBTech will address the current limitations that conventional technologies for air pollution control encounter when treating difficult waste gas streams containing mixtures of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with variable composition and medium concentrations. By combining two techniques, non-thermal plasma and biotrickling filter, VOC emissions generated in industrial activities will be efficiently and cost-effectively treated allowing SMEs in Europe to comply with emission limit values and legislation.",
