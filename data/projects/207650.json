    "objective": "HAIRD project aims to deliver a new design for a next generation aircraft seating which is comfortable,light-weight, fast to disassemble, easy to dismantle, cost efficient to produce, highly recyclable and reliable in structural integrity. Within the HAIRD project a new mono-materials cushions will be developed to improve the easy-recyclability and the cost production. Topological and geometrical optimization techniques will be applied by means of computational tools to ensure weight reduction without compromising the structural reliability. This approach will be used in both structure and cushions combined by selection of very light-materials in the market. A new mechanical system also will be designed allowing fast assembly, dismantling and disassembly of the seat into the aircraft, shortening the maintenance cost and workforce. Finally an assessment of seating Life-cycle will be done to guarantee the new design improvement in terms of sustainability. The direct impact is expected in terms of sustainability, economical viability, novel attractive, cost reduction in maintenance and material, fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.",
