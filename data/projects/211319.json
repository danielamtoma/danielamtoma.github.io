    "objective": "S-6000 Dual Transceivers are miniaturised data links designed to provide reliable wideband communications for critical platforms on-the-move, with the best price-performance ratio in the market.\n\nThe number of critical applications requiring reliable data links under high-dynamic conditions is increasing. The market need and growth is led by RPAS. With a huge market potential for infrastructure surveillance, firefighting, disaster or environmental monitoring, as well as border control and management, RPAS have been earmarked as one of four capability development priorities by the European Council. Other platforms such as Space Launchers, Balloons, Autonomous Vehicles or Maritime Facilities also require high-performance links with similar characteristics. \n\nHowever, solutions providing reliable high-speed data rate and long range communications on-the-move, are very expensive and they are only commercialised under hard export regulations for defence applications. S-6000 Dual Transceivers will provide a high-performance solution at a reasonable price closing an existing gap in the market, between expensive and export regulated systems and unreliable links for consumer applications.",
