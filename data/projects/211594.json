    "objective": "A phase 1 project to establish precise market opportunity, detailed specifications and basis for collaboration with adopting partners use cold-cathode electron sources based on synthetic diamond for satellite communications. Specifically the work will focus on the use of the technology to greatly enhance the performance and life of Travelling Wave Tubes Ã± still the most efficient way of amplifying high frequencies from Ku band up to the Q and W bands. The output of the project will include specifications and project plans for a Phase 2 application along with an overall business plan, including a short list of potential collaborators, allowing a consortium to move forward to implementation of products using this radically disruptive technology. This project will give a European lead in a new technology which has applications in space, radar, instrumentation and high voltage technology.",
