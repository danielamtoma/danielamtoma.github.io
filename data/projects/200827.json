    "objective": "The goal of the project is to develop high performance turbocharger for aeronautical application. This machine will allow increasing power density, efficiency and maintainability of the aeronautical piston engine. Key objectives for the equipment are:\nï\tHigh compressor pressure ratio (up to approx. 5:1)\nï\tHigh corrected compressor air flow rate (up to 350 g/sec)\nï\tCapability to be used in broad range of altitude (min. 6000m) and temperatures (ISA \\/- 35∞C)\nï\tCapability to cope with high gyroscopic loads (up to 9G and 4 rad/sec in all directions)\nï\tLong endurance at high loads (MTBF at least 1200hrs, with inspection interval min 500hrs)\nï\tLow maintenance and high robustness, with emphasis on capability to cope with oil pollution and flow variation, including ability to operate without oil for certain amount of time)\nï\tCapable to operate without wastegate and actuator\nï\tLow weight\nï\tAeronautical certificability\nProject targets will be evaluated by performing testing on the gas stand modified to meet specific requirements of the project. After the tests Post Test Analysis will be performed to assess condition of the parts and create recommendation for further developments aiming on having turbocharger ready for certification and production.",
