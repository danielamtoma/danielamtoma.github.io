    "objective": "In the FORECAST PoC we will explore the industrial applicability and potential for commercialization of the new fast simulation technology developed in REALTIME for the enhanced design of mould filling processes in casting manufacturing operations of mechanical components.\nThe computational technology tested In the FORECAST PoC will allow the casting industry, and in particular SMEs, to solve mould filling problems in times useful for taking decisions helping the design and operation of casting processes. In addition the REALTIME technology will allow users taking into account the multi-fluid character of mould filling processes, including coupled thermal-flow effects in both the air contained in the mould and the molten metal and heat transfer between the flowing melt and the mould walls. \nThe FORECAST PoC will greatly help move the REALTIME software technology towards the initial steps of an innovation process leading to a new extremely fast and accurate mould filling simulation software for enhanced design of casting manufacturing operations of mechanical components for a wide range of applications in industry",
