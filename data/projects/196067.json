    "objective": "The development of a reliable photon source is vital for the development of new quantum technologies. There are many platforms currently being pursued to develop quantum simulators and quantum computers, but one point remains clear Ã± photons will be required to allow such systems to talk to one another; they are the only logical choice for quantum communication due to their low decoherence, ease of encoding and the fact that they do not readily interact with each other. In this fellowship project I will combine cutting edge photonic device engineering and molecular single photon emitters to build a reliable, scalable photon source.  The organic dye molecule dibenzoterrylene (DBT) shows promise for use as a photon source with lifetime limited emission linewidths, a high quantum yield and an emission wavelength well matched to that of rubidium for interfacing with atomic quantum technology. I will interface these molecules with nanophotonic cavities and waveguides and utilise the advanced semiconductor fabrication capabilities of the University of York in a secondment phase to create novel, functional devices which will ultimately lead to the desired molecular photon source.",
