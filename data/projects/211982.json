    "objective": "A range of new medical therapies and diagnostics based on magnetic nanomaterials have recently been proposed.  These include cancer therapies, stem cell therapies, microfluidic diagnostic devices and immunoassays.  However, very few biotechnology magnetic nanomaterials are currently available commercially; most investigators fabricate their own.  This is a serious limitation to the development of this emerging area within nanomedicine. This proposal aims to transfer a number of magnetic nanomaterials from the University physics laboratory where they were developed as part of an ERC AdG grant into an existing small company where they can then be made available to researchers across the world on a commercial basis.",
