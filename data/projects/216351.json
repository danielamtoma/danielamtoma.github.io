    "objective": "The P2P Digital consortium consists of four innovation support organisations from Belgium, Denmark, Germany and Sweden, who recognise the need  for mutual learning on methods and systems to support digitalisation of SME. The four organisations will utilise the twinning\\ method, running a series of workshops to learn from each others' experiences of providing innovation and digitalisation support to companies, including direct support to companies in the ICT sectors, as well as manufacturing companies which need to adopt digital technologies in order to remain competitive. The four organisations are from leading, innovative regions of Europe, and understand the need to provide relevant support to high-growth potential SME. \n\nThe work will result in a Design Options Paper (DOP), which will be used as the template for learning within the consortium, as well as a conduit for further communication to other business and innovation support organisations. The P2P Digital team has in place, well-established communication platforms and can ensure a far wider dissemination that the consortium alone.",
