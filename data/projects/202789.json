    "objective": "Ocean acidification (OA) is expected to profoundly alter the diversity and function of marine ecosystems, as well as the services they provide to society. Thus, understanding how future oceans will function in the face of OA represents one of the major challenges and needs for marine science and management. \n\nHowever, most of the studies to date on OA have consisted of short- to medium- timescale laboratory experiments of single species exposed in isolation to OA. Consequently, our understanding and ability to predict the impacts of OA at the community and ecosystem levels are extremely limited. There is, therefore, a great need for empirical investigations of the long-term effects of OA on marine ecosystems exposed to high pCO2, as found around naturally acidified systems. \n\nTo fill the remaining knowledge gap of the emergent effects of OA on coastal marine ecosystems, I will adopt a multidisciplinary perspective by integrating three novel approaches: 1) functional-community level studies in natural CO2 vent systems; 2) use of newly developed multi-stressors experimental FOCE systems; and 3) genomic studies of the adaptive capacity of marine species to OA. Moreover, we will use virtual reality to increase public understanding of OA.\n\nThis research, based on innovative and high-level training, is expected to generate a better understanding and ability to assess marine functional biodiversity vulnerability. Future4Oceans has a strong link to management and policy advice at EU and international levels. It directly addresses the H2020 Work Programme priorities of climate action and sustainable environment. This project will not only reinforce, extend, and diversify the scientific expertise of the fellow by facilitating the development of methodological skills but propel her career towards scientific independence and professional maturity.",
