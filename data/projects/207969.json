    "objective": "'Antibiotic resistance is an increasingly serious European and global health issue both for humans and animals, limiting the treatment options ó or making them less effective ó while decreasing the quality of life. It also entails serious economic consequences in terms of rising health care costs and productivity losses. The presence of antibiotic-resistant micro-organisms in the food chain is a current problem since certain bacterial species traditionally considered ìnot dangerousî for human health may become ìdangerousî because they act as a genetic reservoir, transferring information regarding resistance to antibiotic molecules to other bacteria which, instead, could be dangerous for human health. \nThrough our specialization, our company can make an important contribution to combating antibiotic resistance. In fact, Sacco srl is an Italian SME that produces and markets food-grade 'starter' cultures. \nThe goal of this project is to help fight the spread of antibiotic resistance through the food chain. Instead of using chemicals (biocides) whose long-term impact is not known, we intend to achieve this aim through biotechnology.\nWe would in this way stay ahead of regulations, which we know are currently under preparation, and gain a competitive advantage that will translate into significant company growth in terms of personnel and turnover.'",
