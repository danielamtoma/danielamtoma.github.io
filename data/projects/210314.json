    "objective": "The project will develop a seismic-resistant steel frame for high seismic resilience. The frame consists of a moment-resisting frame equipped with concentric braces. Replaceable energy-dissipative hourglass shape pins made of duplex stainless steel that results in high post-yield stiffness are in series connected to the braces. Moreover, replaceable fuses are introduced at the locations of the beams of the moment resisting frame where plastic hinges are expected to develop. The project uses an\nintegrated experimental-numerical research methodology to evaluate the seismic performance of the proposed configuration. Emphasis is placed in developing a reliable seismic design methodology for the practical application of the proposed system.",
