    "objective": "PENTABIOL has developed and tested PROBISAN, a fermented fodder improver for nutrition of animals that overtakes the\nperformance of any other fodder improver on the market. The most strict and unbiased product test has been undertaken on\na single commercial swine farm in Spain comparing PROBISAN and the leading product on the market. Each product was\nused to feed during the same period of a population of 1.575 piglets (252 each fodder). PROBISAN piglets ate 10% less and\ngrew 4% more than competition piglets. Considering both effects PROBISAN offers 14% more yield than the best product on\nthe market. Furthermore the average deviation of results with the group of 7 independent tests showed that PROBISAN is\nmuch more stable than the other fodders.",
