    "objective": "In our days, the effect of weather conditions, natural disasters, conflicts between peoples, refurbishment of degraded / weal structures requires daily bypasses to allow the freedom of movement of people. When a bridge collapse, the modular bridges available on the market are one of the conventional solutions that allow to restore the damaged infrastructures. In addition to the tragic human losses that these events often cause, there is always a high social and economic impact/cost due to the time between collapse and the bridge complete installation, that can reach several weeks or even months. BERD developed a new superfast launching system capable of launching an innovative modular bridge solution or even current modular bridges, based in a telescopic boom that can reduce the assembling and launching time up to 70%. Economic analysis shows that higher the importance of the road artery, higher is the payback of using the new Super Fast Telescopic Launching System (SF-TLS). Decision makers and roads and highways managers will have the opportunity to choose a fast reestablishment solution with a very important social and economic impact.",
