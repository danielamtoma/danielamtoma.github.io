    "objective": "Transition-metal catalysed C-H activation is a powerful tool to functionalise and derivatize organic molecules at seemingly inert sites. The strategy opens new efficient synthetic routes to existing molecules and provides access to novel ones. Our aim is to develop palladium catalysed sp3 C-H activation technology for the synthesis of nitrogen heterocycles and for the derivatization of simple secondary amines to high value molecules. Our proposal will address demand in the pharmaceutical industry for the efficient synthesis of nitrogen-containing molecules to aid medicinal chemistry and accelerate the drug discovery processes.",
