    "objective": "The mail goal of this proposal is the recruitment of a postdoctoral researcher from other countries to explore an innovation business idea, the development of a Femtosecond (Fs) Temporally Coherent Supercontinuum (SC) Fiber Laser for Multi-Photon Microscopy (MPM). FYLA LASER S.L. expects to recruit a highly qualified specialist in photonics, that is not available on the Spanish job market, but whose knowledge would be crucial to open up opportunities for innovation and significant growth for the enterprise. This project will contribute to place FYLA in an advanced position versus competitors in the field of non-linear microscopy, as the first worldwide manufacturing company of Fs Temporally Coherent SC Fiber Laser. FEMTOCOLORS will develop the technologies necessary to realize efficient laser emission in the visible in the all-fiber laser configuration. With this regard, the Innovation Associate will address the challenges currently not overcome to develop coherent SC lasers of pulsewidths down to 10 fs, covering the VIS region.",
