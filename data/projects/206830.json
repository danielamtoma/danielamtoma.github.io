    "objective": "InboundMuseô is a revolutionary tool that automates the entire process from data mining to insight generation and furthermore suggesting the optimal solution just as a human would ñ something unique in the realm of digital marketing. This would save hours from an analystís job. When this powerful tool is introduced in an agency setting with multiple clients, its effects are cumulative and the agency ends up saving days off its schedule, which means faster delivery, better client satisfaction and client retention. Client retention is the crucial factor for an agency because its 10x more expensive to sell to a new client then to an existent client. Through SME Instrument Phase 1, we are seeking finance to prepare a Feasibility Study and Business Plan to determine in-depth the possibility, feasibility, risk, viability, profitability and sustainability of this new project.",
