    "objective": "NeurIMM has been designed to investigate the commercial and technical viability of a novel, targeted therapy for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), based on a recently uncovered signaling axis between intestinal type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) and enteric glial cells. This discovery by the team of Prof. Henrique Veiga-Fernandes in the ERC CoG grant 647274 ëGliaInnateSensingí was recently published in Nature (Ibiza et al, Nature 2016). NeurIMM proposes the use of a glial cell-derived immunomodulator to restore intestinal homeostasis, by inducing a tissue protective immune response. Importantly, this novel therapy will also promote tissue healing to reverse immune-cell mediated tissue damage, leading to improved outcomes for the patient. This could have major implications for patients suffering from IBD. In addition, this approach also has potential as an effective therapy against cancer, (pediatric) gastroenteritis and other inflammatory disorders.",
