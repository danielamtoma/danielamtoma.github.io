    "objective": "The invention of super-resolution optical microscopy, commonly referred to as optical nanoscopy, has provided a glimpse of future impacts on cell-biology and health. Imagine the possibilities of scientific discoveries if every research and clinical lab is equipped with an optical nanoscope that is capable of imaging with resolution of sub-50 nm. \nEven though nanoscopy offers unprecedented opportunities, the widespread adoption of present nanoscopy is limited due to its present limitations, mainly system complexity and high ownership cost, next to technical limitations such as low throughput, slow-imaging speeds and lack of multi-modality.\nIn the ERC PoC project, I will develop user-friendly photonic chip-based nanoscopy, to be used in a standard microscope, where sample is placed on top of a photonic chip capable of both holding and illuminating the sample, enabling to acquire super resolved images. Photonic-chips together with coupling unit can be retrofitted to any existing standard microscope converting it to high-resolution optical nanoscope.",
