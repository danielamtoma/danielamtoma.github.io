    "objective": "SMA currently manufacture a 4 cylinder air cooled diesel engine. It will render this product more competitive in the market place if it has a higher power output (\\20%) and is lighter (10%). This proposal by Ilmor Engineering Ltd presents a program of work to achieve these objectives.\n\nIt is proposed to use start of the art analysis techniques and invent solutions for:-\n\na. Cooling the cylinder head.\nb. Improved strength coupled with simplified assembly and manufacturing of the crankcase.\nc. Improved layout of the engine with regard to the turbocharger position.",
