    "objective": "The main objective of PROSO is to foster societal engagement under the terms of RRI in the research and innovation systems in Europe through generation of a policy guide for developing governance for the advancement of societal engagement under RRI in relation to three fields of R&I.\nThe policy guide will be based on the results that PROSO will achieve through an analysis of barriers and incentives for engaging Third sector actors and citizens under the terms of RRI in relation to publicly funded research including public-private partnership research initiatives.\nThis analysis will be carried out across three R&I domains (nanotechnology; food & health; bio-economy) focusing on selected cases of R&I situations in each domain and be based on an investigation of the points of view of Third sector actors and citizens and of other stakeholders/actors contributing significantly to RRI including science/technology policy makers, research funders, academics, and industry/businesses. \nMain methods used will be semi-structured interviews with the major actors contributing to RRI; national citizen panels that will be carried out in five European countries; an European multi-actor deliberation event on promising approaches to encourage and implement societal engagement under the terms of RRI; and a couple of expert/stakeholder workshops on selected topics.",
