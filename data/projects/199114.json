    "objective": "After years of isolated experiences carried out by Telcos and Banks, resulting in 55 failed mobile wallet initiatives across Europe (!), it appears that only an open, secure, cost-effective, neutral, fully scalable mobile wallet multisided platform with a ìplatform modelî, has the capacity to federate the incumbent players willing to address the opportunity of mobile commerce (in-store with NFC, and online), and create the necessary user adoption. \n\nThis is what TORO is demonstrating in Norway, with 70% of the Banks and soon 100% of the Telcos connected to the VALYOU platform (http://www.valyou.no/en), where TORO is the key technological and now business partner.\n\nAfter proving that TOROís unique technology/model has been deployed successfully in Norway, our immediate objective is to replicate the model in Spain or France (then the Netherlands and Poland), before the Over-the-Top players (namely the Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon) come in.",
