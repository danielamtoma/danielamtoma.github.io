    "objective": "This project will serve to evaluate market opportunities of a newly invented technology for digital detection of reporter DNA\nstrands in protein analysis.\nThe purpose of my ongoing ERC project ProteinSeq is to develop technology and reagents for parallel, sensitive and\nspecific targeted protein analyses in plasma samples, lysates, etc. An important limiting factor for the broader adoption of\nour technology is the cost and throughput of next generation sequencing and realtime PCR to read out the identities and\nlevels of reporter DNA strands that reflect the amounts of proteins in a sample.\nIn the course of the ERC project we have invented and patented a technique to greatly enhance each of the reporter\nstrands to prominent DNA objects that can be easily detected, identified and counted by fluorescence microscopy with\nautomated image analysis or through flow cytometry. We refer to this highly specific technique as super rolling circle\namplification or sRCA, and it involves two generations of RCA and combinatorial fluorescence detection of the large\nproducts, each composed of hundreds of thousand repeats of specific tag DNA sequences.\nIn the proposed PoC project we will position our new technology against other readout techniques such as next gen\nsequencing, realtime PCR and microarrays by identifying Needs, Approach, Benefits, Competition for sRCA. Potential end\nusers will be contacted to establish customer requirements, and we will evaluate freedom to operate and the extent of\nmonopoly for our invention. We will also specifically investigate means to distinguish many sRCA products by combinatorial\nlabeling schemes.",
