    "startDate": "01/02/2017",
    "endDate": "31/01/2021",
    "objective": "SOLUTION will provide research and training program for 14 early stage researchers (ESR) pursuing their PhD in various\ndisciplines covering the broadly defined area of solid lubricant coatings. The project combines theoretical approaches\nrepresented by advanced nanoscale simulations, laboratory design and fabrication of novel solid lubricants supported by\nsimulations, and the up-scaling of promising solutions and their application in selected emerging engineering applications.\nSOLUTION will link industries from various areas dealing with similar issues through intensive training and knowledge\nsharing. Three topics driven by industrial partners have been selected to demonstrate the added value of simultaneous\ndevelopment and training. The use of modern solid lubricants underlines the transformation of industry towards smart\ndesign, which is based on predictive models and cross-communication throughout the entire production chain.\nFellows supported by the project will have a unique opportunity to gain competence ranging from simulation, characterization\nand processing, to industrial processes and entrepreneurship. Highly individualized multidisciplinary training reflecting actual\nmarket needs, together with scientific excellence, will generate an open-mind generation able to harvest multidisciplinary\nknowledge and to successfully face challenges represented by the design of competitive solid lubricants.",
