    "objective": "Scattering amplitudes are our primary window on fundamental physics, but despite spectacular advances in recent years their computation remains extremely computationally intensive. Bootstrap techniques, in which an ansatz for the amplitude is constrained with limited kinematic data, are in principle the most efficient possible method, allowing researchers to skip both long sums over diagrams and complicated multidimensional integrals. My collaborators and I have shown the power of these techniques in six particle amplitudes up to six loops, quantities complex enough to be inaccessible to other methods. So far, though, we have applied these techniques only in planar maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. In this project, my objective is to generalize these techniques beyond the supersymmetric case, to build it into a powerful general tool for computing scattering amplitudes. I will pursue this objective in two ways: by investigating amplitudes that require functions outside of the polylogarithms that were used in earlier cases, and by bootstrapping quantities, such as correlation functions and amplitudes in non-planar theories, that have more general behavior.",
