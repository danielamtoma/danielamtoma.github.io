    "objective": "Fatty Liver disease (FLD) is a widespread disease which can often progress to Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, cirrhosis and liver cancer. At present FLD disease affects a huge perportion of the population and prompt treatment will be of major health benefits to the general population. We have developed a specific therapeutic targeting a microRNA we and others have shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of FLD. This therapeutic agent can dramatically reduce FLD in a mouse model. We would like to extend the pre-clinical studies in order to encourage interest of a pharmaceutical company who will license the technology and pursue clinical trials.",
