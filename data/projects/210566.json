    "objective": "During the recent years, biological materials have extensively inspired materials scientists towards new properties, e.g., for composites, photonics, and wetting. The future grand challenge is to mimic biological active materials towards new properties that commonly have not been connected with man-made materials. Due to the biological complexity, conceptually new approaches are needed in materials science. In the project DRIVEN, field-driven dissipative out-of-equilibrium self-assemblies are developed in the colloidal and molecular scale. In the proposal, instead of using chemical fuels to drive dissipative self-assemblies, which is ubiquitous in Nature, imposed fields are here used to drive the system out-of-equilibrium towards new assemblies and functions.  The project show steps with growing risks towards highly ambitious new materials mimicking aspects from active biological materials.",
