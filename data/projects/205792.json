    "objective": "SecTrapô is a security suite that is built on our novel and proprietary Virtual Machine Behavioural Introspection (VMBI)\ntechnology and complements existing software security systems already invested by organisations. SecTrapô ensures that\nprotected assets are inaccessible to malicious software and uses advanced AI to detect, block and report abnormal\nbehaviours. We want to be the first to commercialise this novel solution that is designed to protect critical urban\ninfrastructures and soft targets against new and imminent cyber attacks. Through SME Instrument Phase 1, we are seeking\nfinance to prepare a Feasibility Study and Business Plan to determine in-depth the possibility, feasibility, risk, viability,\nprofitability and sustainability of this new project.",
