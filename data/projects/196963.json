    "objective": "Wear3D display technology project is an ERC-Advanced project and offers novel optical solutions for wearable (or head-mounted) displays to achieve very wide field-of-view and natural-looking 3D. The Wear3D technology has a lot of potential as the global consumer market for Head Mounted Displays market was valued at USD 342.7 million in 2011, and is expected to reach US$9.3 billion by 2019.\nThe Wear3D technology is very strong on IPR position and the initial results obtained in the lab are very promising. The objective of this proposal is to exploit the commercial potential of the Wear3D display technology. Such a display integrated with imagers and sensors is a breakthrough technology for the next generation human computer interface",
