    "objective": "This proposal will develop a novel strategy for processing graphene nacre-like composite materials and will address study of of their multifunctional applications as as proof-of-concept.  Impedance-dominated applications such as high anticorrosive performance heat-healable coatings, excellent electromagnetic interference shields and flexible all-solid-state supercapacitors will be targeted. Our composite structures will mimic the brick-mortar layers found in natural nacre, to comply with exceptional strength and toughness requirements, and will have controllable graphene-graphene interlayer distances to tune diffusive and conductive properties as per the requirements of the target applications. The aim is to achieve a tailor-made combination of unique mechanical and electrical/diffusive properties by adapting the layered composite structure at different length scales with a simple manufacturing protocol, hence exploiting the outstanding properties of graphene and conferring our conductive composite films precisely designed functionalities.",
