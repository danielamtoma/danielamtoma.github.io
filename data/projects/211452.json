    "objective": "Modern communication and sensing is done with radio- and microwaves on the one hand, and with optical fiber links, on the other. Radio- and microwaves are widely used in commercial and personal communication, as well as in sensing in, for example, medical diagnostics. Optical communication dominates long distance, point-to-point connections, such as internet. This action aims at the development of a miniature device for efficient conversion between these technological platforms.  Within the AdG INTERFACE we have developed a novel principle for the opto-electromechnical transducer (Nature, 2014) and filed a US patent. We have further made progress in developing an integrated version of the transducer with enhanced sensitivity. Preliminary market analysis has shown high potential of our device in diverse areas, such as industrial internet of things, airborne intracommunication systems, scientific sensors, measurement instrumentation, radio astronomy, and nuclear magnetic spectroscopy. This action will include the first tests of the device in a flagship application relevant to NMR spectroscopyóa real life MRI scanneróand an extensive effort towards producing a packaged, fiber-coupled, ultralow-noise transducer ready for field demonstrations.",
