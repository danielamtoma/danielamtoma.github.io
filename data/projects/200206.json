    "objective": "Cytometry (the characterisation and counting of cells) is essential to clinical diagnostics, biotechnology, food industry, water monitoring and many fields of research. Within the ERC Starting Grant, InstantCount, inkjet printing methods have been developed, which allow us to fabricate cell counting chambers with on-chip sample preparation, simplifying cell counting procedures tremendously. By effectively eliminating all sample preparation steps and efficient usage of reagents CyPod promises low-cost, simple, rapid cell counting, including mobile applications. The fabrication by inkjet printing enables us to offer tailor-made solutions. We expect that CyPod tests can replace expensive and complex instruments in many existing cell counting applications, as well as open new markets, e.g. in agriculture and food industry. This project aims at evaluating and enhancing the competitiveness of CyPod cell counting technology by analysing the market, comparing CyPod with potential competitors and adapting our concept to identified customers√≠ needs. A product demonstration for potential customers and partners will be prepared and the optimal business strategy will be selected for which a business plan will be devised.",
