    "objective": "Immunotherapy is a promising approach to treat cancer and infectious diseases, but innovative approaches are required.\nThe cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway can induce a potent immune response against viruses. It is also implicated in antitumoral immune responses that are effective. We have recently discovered that the small second messenger cGAMP can be packaged by viruses to stimulate immunity in target cells. We have developed methods to produce non-infectious virus-like particles containing cGAMP (cGAMP-VLPs) that strongly stimulate this innovative immune pathway. We will test the idea that cGAMP-VLPs are potent activators of anti-tumoral and anti-viral immunity. To reach this proof-of-concept, we propose pre-clinical development plan in translational mouse models.",
