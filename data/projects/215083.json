    "objective": "Fedor Miloserdov (FMM, the fellow) alongside Prof. Mike Whittlesey (MKW, University of Bath, UK) designed the RuZn proposal that deals with heterobimetallic late transition metal ñ Lewis acidic metal complexes, particularly ones featuring an unsupported RuñZn bond. Having similar properties with other Pt-group metals, Ru is more than order of magnitude cheaper. The cooperativity between Ru and Lewis acidic metal (Zn) can enhance the stability, selectivity and reactivity of the catalytic system and lead to new catalytic applications of ruthenium complexes, making them more appealing for both academia and industry. The rationale for the RuZn project is the 2016 report by MKW on the convenient approach to a novel complex with an unsupported RuñZn bond. FMM is going to synthesize a family of new RuñZn complexes with different ligand environments and systematically study their reactivity and stability in order to find suitable catalytic applications. The RuZn proposal aims not only at developing a new range of ruthenium catalysts, but will also provide FMM a unique opportunity to work on the cutting edge of science, as well as improve his skills in leadership, teaching, mentoring and grant-management. As an interdisciplinary part of the program, FMM will have a secondment with Prof. Stuart Macgregor (SAM) at Heriot-Watt university (Edinburgh, UK), where he will acquire knowledge in computational chemistry while studying the RuñZn bonding and reactivity.",
