The multi-facet consultation process will be governed by a SpeakNGI.eu established, self-sustaining European Champions Panel (ECP) that will initially be composed of carefully selected stakeholder representatives. SpeakNGI.eu will ensure that the ECP along with the established consultation processes will sustain right through to support the highly ambitious NGI Flagship.",
