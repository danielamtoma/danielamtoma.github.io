    "objective": "The project aims to industrialize an innovative steering group for the motorcycle industry; the main objective is to recover economic competitiveness in the automotive sector. In last ten years, European market has lost significant market shares in favor of low-cost countries. Also Cometa, that have managed up to 25% of the market of steering groups, found a significant loss of the market share.\nFor achieve this goal Cometa proposes to realize an innovative aluminum steering-triangles with composite technology using aluminum realized with cold technology plus a specific aluminum foam.\nA feasibility study that tests on technological, productive and economical level, the potential use of  the innovative steering for the motorcycle industry. For the technical feasibility, Cometa will be supported by University of L'Aquila (Engineering department) and the University of Rome Tor Vergata.\nThe initial reference market will be the complete steering systems production in aluminium, for the high quality motorcycle sector. The customers/OEM  premium selected are HONDA, BMW for the following reasons: \n誰 Consolidated relationship (especially with HONDA)\n誰 They both belong to high quality standards in the market\n誰 They adopt high standards for the quality and reliability\n誰 They are large-scale producers",
