    "startDate": "01/04/2016",
    "endDate": "30/09/2017",
    "objective": "The ìFeelSpeechî project will provide proof of concept of a novel prosthesis that will allow people with hearing loss to better understand speech. The prosthesis will be worn on the wrist and will resemble a wristwatch. A special, novel kind of tactile stimulation called ìmicrostrokingî provided by the device will supplement what a person hears, and this information will be unconsciously made use of by the userís brain, providing improved speech perception even when the user has almost lost all hearing.",
