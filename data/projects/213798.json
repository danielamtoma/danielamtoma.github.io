    "objective": "The aim of the project is to design, define, realize and test one prototype of adjustable length structural rods that can withstand high loads encountered in the aeronautical field.\nTwo overall concepts will be studied and one of them will be retained for the prototype.\nFirst solution consist to reinforce existing adjustable rods locally by welding titanium threaded inserts in order to support high loads and avoid fatigue problems.\nThe second solution consists to invent a welded assembly method and the associated tool in order to complete the manufacture of rods on the aircraft during integration phase.\nDuring this project, the AVANTIS Company, specialized in innovative aeronautical design and ARMINES laboratory will take the required measures to evolve from first ideas to the final demonstrator and to upgrade the technology readiness level (TRL) from 2 to 4.",
