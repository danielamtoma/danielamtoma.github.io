    "objective": "The highest priority for around 17.000 European SMMs in the next few years is to implement a digital age shift in order to find a new and sustainable business model that works within the context of our changing society. Going digital for SMMs, with few paid staff and limited resources, is challenging. A recent survey highlights that most significant barriers to digital development in Museums are slow or limited IT systems and network (52%), lack of time (80%) and lack of resources (66%).CoMwork srl an innovative and social start-up, spin off of TAI: has been created to further proceed with the market readiness of CoMwork's solution, a  game-changing platform for museum collection management that fosters a new business model for the sector. Being 64% lower cost than alternative solutions, Small and medium museums (SMM) will avoid upfront investments for licencing or high annual fees and costs for additional modules. Through the project we expect an increase of around 700.000 new digital content pages available on the web from SMMs by 2020, meaning an increased revenue of target museums of around 20%. In combination, expected revenues for CoMwork are estimated to be around 4,2MÃ„ in 4 years from market launch.",
