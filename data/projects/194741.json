    "objective": "The EFFGT project aims to develop a feasibility study and all the elements needed for a comprehensive business plan to Aurelia Turbines Oy for selling very high efficient micro gas turbines (microturbines).\n\nAurelia is a Company that has been established to commercialize microturbine developed by Lappeenranta university of Technology / Finland (LUT). The microturbine has a nominal power output of 450 kW with a net electrical efficiency of 45,8%. This is more than with any existing technology in this class. Furthermore, the easy recovery of excess heat from clean exhaust gas makes the microturbine well suitable for almost any combined heat and power (CHP) application. This microturbine has the possibility to be a real game changer of the decentralized power generation and CHP.\n\nIn this project a strong focus is being given to determine the end-customer needs and expectations, sales network, cost structure and overall financial planning of the company. The technical development of the microturbine itself will be conducted by LUT.",
