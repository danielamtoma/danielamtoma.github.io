    "objective": "The Internet-of-Nano-Things (IoNT) paradigm has the potential to dramatically transform society and is recognised as one of the top 10 emerging technologies by the World Economic Forum. In order to connect nano-scale devices, this timely fellowship will focus on molecular signalling, which underpins multi-scale coordinated biological actions. Despite its prevalent nature, we do not yet understand the information carrying potential of molecular signals in complex and multi-scale fluids, nor do we know how to design credible communication protocols. Inspired by these challenges, the objectives of this fellowship are: (1) bridge fluid dynamic and communication theory knowledge by combining complex fluid dynamic experiments with molecular communication testing, and (2) design and test innovative capacity achieving communication protocols in complex diffusion-advection environments. The experienced applicant and the scientist-in-charge have the joint ambitious vision to achieve fundamental understanding of the underpinning science through the co-creation of inter-disciplinary knowledge. The project will provide career accelerating training and knowledge transfer and enable the applicant to become a world leader in molecular communications and create sustainable societal impact.",
