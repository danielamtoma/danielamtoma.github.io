    "objective": "Re(search) will connect the citizens of Dublin with research through two fringe-festival events held in 2016 and in 2017. For each event, Dubliners will be invited to the iconic Front Square of Trinity College Dublin where they will explore how research is addressing societal challenges (the same societal challenges laid out in H2020). The societal challenges will be explored using a range of formats including comedy, drama, dining, story-telling, and citizen-science. These have been chosen to spark conversations between researchers and citizens on issues that matter to peopleís lives. Conversations will allow citizens to construct their own views on research topics and the role of research in our society (and as a career). Constructivist approaches to learning are known to lead to enhanced learning outcomes in formal learning settings. This proposal is based on the idea that a constructivist approach to learning can also be applied to informal learning environments, such as Re(search) Night.\nDubliners will be made aware of the two Re(search) events through an advertising campaign on Dublinís Metro train (based on an award winning model designed by the coordinator). Evaluation of the project will be integral to its success with best-practices applied at all stages. Re(search) 2016 and 2017 will be delivered by a management team that has considerable experience in science communication, science education, public engagement and project management. \nThe Re(search) concept outlined in this proposal is a novel way to engage large numbers of citizens. It is based on a number of previous, successful, campaigns and has a strong grounding in published best-practice.",
