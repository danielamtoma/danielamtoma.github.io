    "objective": "Although some biotechnologies have made huge strides e.g. in automation, data generation, or biochemical methods, cell handling still uses antiquated methods that limit the scale at which assays can be performed. Our ERC-funded microfluidics work has lead to cutting-edge microdroplet manipulation tools for cell handling: While working with 3D cell cultures, we have recently shown that we can obtain great increases in both throughput and detail, while reducing the sample use and the machine footprint. In addition to these quantitative leaps, the microfluidic format also allows qualitatively new biological constructs to be explored by making significant steps towards the organ-on-a-chip framework. The current project therefore aims to show how the technologies developed in our lab can function together in an integrated cell screening platform. This will require demonstrating a convincing proof of concept of the hardware, software, and workflow, in addition to demonstrating the added value to different industries.",
