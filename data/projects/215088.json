    "objective": "The evolution of the Antarctic Ice Sheet has been widely debated. According to several studies a continent-wide ice sheet\nfirst developed during the early Oligocene and subsequently it experienced many cycles of advance and retreat.\nTectonic, oceanographic, climatic and ice dynamic processes have been pointed to as the primary factors controlling this\noscillation. However, their relative influence is still controversial. Middle Miocene growth of the Antarctic ice sheet has been\nrelated to intensification of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. It was followed by warm episodes during the Mid Miocene\nClimatic Optimum and during the Pliocene when collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet has been suggested. However, the\nstratigraphic signature of such a collapse has not been recognized on West Antarctic continental margins. The main aim of\nthis proposal is examine the record of ice sheet evolution on West Antarctic continental margins from middle Miocene to\npresent and clarify the factors controlling the major sedimentary changes and their global implications.",
