    "objective": "Opportunity: Shipping emissions are expected to double by 2050, as are the related social and environmental effects. The cost of fuel has become a major expense item for every company in the transportation business, possibly more so for Tugboats, Ferries, Dredges, Off-Shore, because their engines (and fuel tanks) are disproportionately large. This situation has force regulators, to act consequently and force operators to implement continues monitoring & efficient solutions\nAdded value proposal: SCOUT  provides a Smart Monitoring & COntrol and User interactive ecosystem for improving energy efficiency and economic maintenance of Medium-WeighT Ships, taking advantage of the above opportunity presented by the necessity and recent regulations, of monitoring and reducing emissions, as well as, the economic need of saving costs in terms of fuel combustion and maintenance of medium-weight ships market, by delivering three key market applications: (i) Upgraded consuming knowledge; (ii) Greater engine performance (estimated from 10% to 20%) (iii) Longer ship life (reduction of 10-25% of operational costs) \nPhase 1 objectives is to accelerate the market adoption and international penetration of SCOUT focus on preparing ourselves for the commercialization of at the international level (including route-to-market, marketing strategy, growth strategy, etc.) by evolving the product from TRL6 to TRL9 stage\nImpact : As a result of this project, SCOUT will grow considerably, generating 73 new qualified jobs by five years after the project ending and generating cumulative incomes of 63.7MÄ and a EBITDA of 35.7MÄ approx (56% of margin)",
