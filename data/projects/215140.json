    "objective": "A successful adaptive immune response requires T cells to be able to adopt a specific metabolic phenotype. However, in\ndiseases such as cancer or those associated with chronic inflammation, the metabolic microenvironment in which a T cell\nfunctions is likely to subvert this metabolic phenotype, thereby disrupting function.\n\nA better understanding of how the microenvironment can affect T cell function would permit the development of metabolic\n'normalising' treatments that could restore function and permit disease resolution.\n\nHowever, there is currently a disconnect within the field of immunometabolism that requires high resolution, direct analyses\nof T cell metabolism in order to solve. We therefore propose an approach that uses stable isotope-enriched metabolites that\nare associated with immunosuppressive cancer microenvironments (e.g. 13C3-lactate) to trace their use in different T cell\npopulations (isolated from healthy peripheral blood), and thereby identify the precise pathway by which they are metabolised\nand how this alters cytotoxic function and proliferative capacity. By inhibiting the metabolic pathway implicated either\npharmacologically, or using physiologically relevant stimuli (e.g. hypoxia), we will unequivocally link use of specific\nimmunomodulatory metabolites, such as lactate, succinate and citrate, with T cell function.",
