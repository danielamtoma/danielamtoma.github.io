    "objective": "'While language is a natural way to interact with artificial characters\nor agents in video games, communication with agents currently tends to\nbe limited to menu systems. To achieve smooth linguistic\ncommunication, utterances need to be grounded in the situation in\nwhich they occur. That is, the meanings of utterances must be learned\nfrom observing their use in some naturally occurring perceptual\ncontext. Recent years have seen much progress in the development of\nvisually- or auditorily-grounded language understanding using novel\nmachine learning techniques such as deep learning. At the same time,\ncompanies like Google DeepMind have introduced deep learning models\nthat can learn to play games at super-human levels. We propose to take\nthis research to the next step, by grounding natural language in video\ngames.\n\nGrounding natural language in video games yields two main\nbenefits. The first benefit is commercial in nature: with the global\nmarket for video games expected to reach $100 billion by 2017, there\nis clearly a large demand for more sophisticated interaction with\nin-game agents. Secondly, video games are a natural way to explore\nartificial intelligence techniques in a 'simulated' world that is\neasier to understand computationally than the extremely complicated\n'real' world.\n\nThe current project will explore natural language grounding in a small\nnumber of appropriate games. Once we are capable of grounding natural\nlanguage in these games, we can translate utterances into\nstraightforward actions for artificial agents. An example might be\ntelling your team members to follow you, to take the left flank, or to\nduck when they are being shot at. Given the recent developments in\nmachine learning and grounded language understanding, we believe that\nnow is the perfect moment to explore these possibilities further.\n'",
