    "objective": "Nano-fluids (fluid bases with a nano-particle suspension) and Phase Change Materials (PCM) provide innovative ways to handle the increased need for heat transfer and thermal efficiency. But information regarding the thermal properties (thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, enthalpy of transformation, enthalpy of fusion/melting, enthalpy of vaporization, specific heat, melting temperature, and crystallization temperature) of nano-fluids and PCMs is limited and antiquated. Therefore, is the purpose of this action to determine the thermal properties of a number of PCMs to then use as the base fluid for a number of nano-fluids. This will be done by measuring n-alkanes in both the solid and liquid phases using the transient hot wire and the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) techniques. When possible, the obtained results will be compared with the scarcely available literature data. Lastly, the creation of a thermal properties prediction model for the nano-fluids will be attempted.",
