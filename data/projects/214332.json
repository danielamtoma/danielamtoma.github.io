    "objective": "Following trends to design Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Good,  (a plea to develop AI in ways addressing pressing problems that face humanity), the focal question we will address is: What is the proper combination of open and proprietary elements in AI innovation in the field of mental health in light of the need to design a system that both promotes innovation and is compatible with the ideals of human dignity, fundamental rights and freedoms, and cultural diversity? Our concern in the context of mental health in particular is that proprietary AI may reproduce gender and racial stereotypes, which in turn may reinforce social stigma and raise a barrier to proper diagnosis and treatments. On the other hand, the present research does not entertain a model of innovation where the proprietary stands in opposition to the open. Rolling back private property does not necessarily favour the weak over the strong. To this effect, we propose to conduct qualitative research to identify public and commercial demands in order to rethink the governance of innovation in AI, focusing in particular on mental health. \nParticipant observation and Interviews with key stakeholders will be conducted to elicit their views, taking into account not only economic but also ethical aspects (diversity, rights and freedoms). The governance question needs to take into account public demands that are technically feasible and at the same time commercially viable in the AI area.",
