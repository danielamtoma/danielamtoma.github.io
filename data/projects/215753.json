    "objective": "The connections between real estate governance and urban climate risk management represent a critical missing link between urban research, policy-making, and practice. Real estate climate risk management practices have important consequences for the welfare and prosperity of at-risk cities, yet climate risk management cultures and practices vary greatly between cities. These highly particular variables shape an increasingly globalized real estate industryís exposure to climate risks in any given context and project. This dynamic and differentiated interaction of institutions, imperatives, and interests that govern real estate climate risk ñ both across the global real estate industry and within at-risk cities -- may be termed the real estate finance-urban climate risk nexus. The proposed project advances the theoretical and empirical understanding of the real estate finance-urban climate risk nexus (i) across the contemporary landscape of real estate finance institutions and (ii) within major coastal property (re)development projects in three case cities, in order to (iii) synthesise a critical and comparative understanding of how understandings of climate risk reshape the global real estate industry finance, and restructure the property markets of vulnerable coastal cities.",
