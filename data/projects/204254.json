    "objective": "We, the consortium responsible of W2C, composed by WECO and VIJO will place in the market a triple-glazed, high-performance insulating wood window named W2C ìWindow to Seeî. Its unique design has been patented and has received two international recognized awards (Red Dot Award 2015, Architectís Newspaper ¥15). W2C will be the first window in the market that combines the strict energy-saving standards demanded by the Passive House Institute and a frameless design that maximizes the window¥s open area. It is oriented to the niche growing market of ìPassive Housingî- highly energy efficient buildings-, offering an alternative to current thick framed windows. Its price is 15% cheaper that the average price of the references in this segment and the lighter structure allows us to offer larger sizes, up to 6 x2.75m. With this window we expect to obtain a relevant position in the market and create 16 new jobs.",
