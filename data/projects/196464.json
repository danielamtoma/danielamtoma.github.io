    "startDate": "01/06/2015",
    "endDate": "31/03/2016",
    "objective": "ìProTreaTî is a 100% natural, cost-effective, resource efficient, multi-purpose and multi-beneficial solution for the removal of heavy metals from water, simultaneously benefitting environmental, social and economic objectives. The innovation of ProTreaT lies in the use of fish-derived proteins to thoroughly remove HM and other pollutants, such as bacteria and viruses, from primary water (i.e. suitable for human consumption and/or suitable for agriculture/breeding) and from industrial process and wastewater, and, therefore, from the food-chain.",
