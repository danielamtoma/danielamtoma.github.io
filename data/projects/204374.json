    "objective": "Our objective in this innovation project is to disrupt data brokerage and analytics industries by introducing Sharemind, a security technology that enables previously impossible data analysis applications.\nSharemind solves the problem where an organization wants to learn something from confidential data owned by a number of other people or organizations. Sharemind allows the data owners to protect their information during the analysis so that any leakage is controlled with machine-enforced means.\nFor example, banks, retailers and governments can collect and share customer/citizen information without compromising privacy. Sharemind encourages rational behaviour in a society.\nBy removing the barriers from information sharing, Sharemind lets governments, companies and researchers reach their full potential and become more efficient.\nWe have validated this capability in multiple real-world prototypes and have achieved legal breakthroughs that make Sharemind a promising technology for Europe.",
