    "objective": "Exosomes and microvesicles/ectosomes, collectively termed extracellular vesicles (EV), have attracted much recent interest because of their potential functions, use as disease biomarkers and possible therapeutic exploitation. Due to their enormous relevance, this relatively new field of research is quickly expanding. While Europe leads the field of EV research, there are still many gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed to ensure optimal exploitation of EVs from health and Europeís economic benefit. Addressing this, TRAIN-EVís objective is to provide excellent and integrated multi-disciplinary and inter-sectoral training of a critical mass of ESRs of outstanding potential in the academic, clinical, and industry/business components of exploiting EV, while performing novel cutting-edge research to address these gaps and generate new knowledge. This will be achieved by appointing 15 ESRs into 10 Beneficiary Organisations (6 academic; 4 non-academic), with 4 additional Partner Organisations (3 non-academic; 1 academic) offering secondments, training and additional networking opportunities. All Participants have highly relevant and complementary medical/science/engineering/business expertise ñdetailed withinñ that will collectively contribute to the training, to PhD level, of these 15 ESRs as academic and industry EV leaders for the future.",
