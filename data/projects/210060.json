    "objective": "Precision measurements are a key application of quantum technology. They have brought record precision in time measurement or outstanding sensitivity in measuring a whole wealth of quantities. Bringing such measurements to the nanoscale is new. If those quantum sensor function under a variety of environments, including ambient or physiological condition they promise unprecedented application.   \n\nSMel aims to exploit the outstanding nanoscale quantum sensing capabilities of spin defects to achieve highly sensitive charge detection down to single elementary charges under ambient conditions. On top of that the project aims to detect and image molecular polarizability with sub-molecular resolution. This will allow to use spin defects as quantum sensors to measure resonant infrared excitation with sub-molecular resolution. It is the visionary aim of SMel to refine these methods to such an extent, that charge transfer inside a single biomolecular photosynthetic reaction centre can be detected and imaged.",
