    "startDate": "01/02/2017",
    "endDate": "31/01/2018",
    "objective": "The idea for this proposal is to demonstrate the design of olfactory widgets (OWidgets) as a proof-of-concept implementation based on the semantic integration of smell to convey specific information to the user. We will showcase the meaningful design of OWidgets in two distinct markets. Widgets are well established as simple application extensions, integrated in a larger application and usually pre-installed on a device. Widgets allow quick access to information without requiring a user to open the application that manages this information. OWidgets will expand the existing range of widgets and provide users with a new non-existing layer of information delivery through smell, and consequently allow the creation of novel experiences in various application contexts.",
