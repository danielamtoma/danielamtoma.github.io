    "objective": "The REBOOT project aims to significantly improve the competitiveness of European urban bus operators through the development of a retrofit all-electric drive system that replaces diesel engines. The objectives of our project include:\n\nï To develop a retrofit all-electric drive system, battery and recharger pack for an 18 tonne bus that weighs less than 2.2 tonnes (the weight of a diesel drive) with the capacity to travel 160km  \nï A final system price of Ä120,000 that delivers a payback to the operator within 3 years\nï To deliver an 80% reduction in fuel operating cost for bus operators \nIn Phase 1, our objectives include: \nï Conduct market sounding activities with at least 10 organisations comprising of customers, regulators and industry experts \nï Identify and establish strategic partnerships with at least 3 European industry partners in our value chain and 2 research institutions capable of enhancing the development and commercialisation of REBOOT\nï Identify and secure at least 1 location and operator for the pilot trial / demonstration of REBOOT \nï Evaluate an initial technology concept design using a design simulation package\nï Conduct a comprehensive review of the IP landscape and identify management strategies",
