    "objective": "University students  continue to develop their physics identity by engaging in practices that are central to the physics community. However, many  students also participate in other relevant practices, such as teaching and outreach. For some, teaching and outreach may be integral to their experience doing physics and building identity, although that may be counter to messaging from advisors or academia about their value. In this work, we investigate university students negotiation of physics identity after they have volunteered in informal physics programs for primary school children. We hypothesize that university students√≠ physics identity is foster or reshaped by the interactions and experiences they have in the program. We analyze university students interviews and responses to pre and post surveys using a blended framework of Self-Determination Theory and Community of Practice frameworks. From this analysis, we extract the experiences that affect their physics identity as they negotiate their memberships in the informal and formal physics communities of practice.",
