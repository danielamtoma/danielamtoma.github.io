    "objective": "The financial market is a relevant part of our economy.  Its crisis spread all over the countries and affect our daily life. Understanding these phenomena has become a crucial field of academic research and a holy grail for investors. In this project, I aim to study and develop models to forecast and manage the risk propagation along simplified structures called dynamical networks with particular emphasis on the morphological changes occurring as back-reaction to the risk spread.",
