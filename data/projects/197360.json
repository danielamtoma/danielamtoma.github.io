    "objective": "Growing competition for top schools and highly qualified roles has driven growth in demand for tutors in the EU and globally (FT, 2013). However, tutoring remains unregulated, without mechanisms to measure performance and over-reliance on referrals (NEESE, 2011), and high transaction costs which price many schools and families out of the market.\n\nTutorfair is a marketplace to help schools and parents find great tutors and, for every student who pays, they give tutoring to a child who can't afford it. Tutorfair has proven the concept of a full lifecycle platform for the tutoring sector which is open, disruptive and innovative:\nï For tutors, AIMS makes it easier to start and build their business, with opportunities for networking, training and observations to continue development;\nï For clients, AIMS makes it easier to find good tutors in a transparent and fair way;\nï For the industry, AIMS opens up access to industry wide accreditation and collaboration; and\nï For society, Tutorfair brings a one-for-one promise to give tutoring to children who can't afford to pay.\nThe results of this project will meet objectives for the Open Disruptive Innovation theme by creating a new paradigm on the fast-growing private tuition market, lowering barriers to entry, empowering local agencies and widening access.\n\nWith support from the SME Instrument Phase 1, Tutorfair will undertake a technical feasibility and commercial viability assessment of AIMS in the EU28, testing the likelihood of commercial success and potential impacts, on this Ä14Bn market.\n\nTutorfairís 15-strong team aims to make tutoring accessible to everyone, impactful, measurable and socially responsible. With 50yrs of combined experience  ommercializing results of R&D for companies incl. LOVEFILM, Sainsburyís, Procter & Gamble, Zyb and PutITout, the Tutorfair team is well placed to exploit the outcomes of this innovative project and make the growth of tutoring good for everyone.",
