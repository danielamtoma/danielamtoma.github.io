    "objective": "The goal of this project is to pursue new methods in the mathematical analysis of non-local and non-linear\npartial differential equations. For this purpose we present several physical scenarios of interest in the context\nof incompressible fluids, from a mathematical point of view as well as for its applications: both from the\nstandpoint of global well-posedness, existence and uniqueness of weak solutions and as candidates for blowup.\nThe equations we consider are the incompressible Euler equations, incompressible porous media equation\nand the generalized Quasi-geostrophic equation. This research will lead to a deeper understanding of the nature\nof the set of initial data that develops finite time singularities as well as those solutions that exist for all time for incompressible flows.",
