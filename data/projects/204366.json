    "objective": "bioburner is the answer to the market to use biomass on industries with uninterrupted heating needs and strict production times.\nWe have developed a hybrid dual burner that combines the best of two technologies on a single burner, avoiding the problems associated with them, with a payback < 1 year.\nOn the one hand biomass:\n- pros: low cost of operation and neutral CO2 emissions;\n- cons: high inertia, which means stop/start times very high;\nOn the other, fossil:\n- pros: instantaneous response time and already present in most installations;\n- cons: high OPEX and CO2 emissions;\nbioburner is compact, safe, plug and play, scalable, cost-effective, efficient, reducing thermal energy cost by 50%, reliable, being able to operate automatically with two fuels and sustainable, reducing CO2 emissions by 95%.",
