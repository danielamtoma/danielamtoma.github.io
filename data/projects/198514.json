    "objective": "STREAM is a 4-year multi-site training network that aims at career development of Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) on\nscientific design, construction manufacturing and of advanced radiation instrumentation. STREAM targets the development\nof innovative radiation-hard, smart CMOS sensor technologies for scientific and industrial applications. The platform\ntechnology developed within the project will be tested in the demanding conditions posed by the CERN LHC detectors√≠\nenvironment as well as European industry leaders in field of CMOS imaging, electron microscopy and radiation sensors.\nThis leveraging factor will allow to fine-tune the technology to meet the requirements of industrial application cases on\ndemand such as electron microscopy and medical X-ray imaging, as well as pathway towards novel application fields such\nas satellite environments, industrial X-ray systems and near-infrared imaging. The project will train a new generation of\ncreative, entrepreneurial and innovative early-stage researchers and widen their academic career and employment\nopportunities. The STREAM consortium is composed of 10 research organisations and 5 industrial partners; the network will\nprovide training to 17 ESRs. STREAM structures the research and training in four scientific work-packages which span the\nwhole value-chain from research to application: CMOS Technologies Assessment, Smart Sensor Design and Layout,\nValidation and Qualification, Technology Integration, and Valorization.",
