    "objective": "SHIP2FAIR aims to foster the integration of solar heat in industrial processes (SHIP) from the agro√±food sector, by developing and demonstrating a set of tools and methods for the development of industrial solar heat projects during its whole life-cycle.\nThus, the project results will consist in a (1) Replication tool for easily assessing the techno-economic feasibility of a SHIP project and supporting its design; (2) a Control tool understand as a DSS to support the operation of the complete process, (3) a comprehensive guide for supporting stakeholders in the design, commissioning and operation of their SHIP projects, and (4) a complete capacity building program, addressing both professionals and students interested in SHIP applications in the agro-food sector. \nThese results will be demonstrated and validated at 4 demo-sites, including representative use cases of the agro-food sector like spirits distillation (Martini & Rossi), ham drying (ABC Industries), sugar boiling (RAR Group) and wine fermentation and stabilization (RODA Wineries). As a results of this demonstration, SHIP2FAIR, aims to achieve up to a 40% of solar fraction with a total of 2.9 kW of installed power for producing 4.04 GWh and allowing 403 m3 of fossil fuels and 1,145 TeqCO2 per year.\nIn order to fulfil these challenges a competitive consortium of EU leading entities has been gathered including 4 RTOs (CIRCE, CEA, ISMB and BE2020) 2 Engineering companies (RINA-C and SOLID), 2 Solar Technology Providers (TVP and ISG) and, 4 agro-food companies already mentioned, 2 sectorial associations (EUREC and SCOOP) and one Utility (EDF), addressing the complete SHIP projects value-chain.",
