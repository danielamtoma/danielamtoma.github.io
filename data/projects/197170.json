    "objective": "'FRESMAK, in collaboration with POLYMAT (University of Basque Country), has developed an alternative innovative clamping element, called TGRIP, based on the principle of adhesion. Main features of TGRIP are:ï Itís a rigid, non-residue leaving, reversible and reusable adhesive material activated and deactivated through temperature (>60?C) that maintains adhesion force at ambient temperature.ï Easy to manufacture, cheap material that can be machined at precisions below 0,003 mm, to create high precision fixture-workpiece contacts and unions.ï Does not compromise the cutting area, exactly like electromagnetic and vacuum clamping.ï Very high adhesion, clamping and cutting forces per unit of surface (1.000 N/cm2), between 6-12 times higher than the electromagnetic and vacuum technologiesThis principle is applicable both to ferromagnetic and non-ferromagnetic materials, and is suitable for thin wall and complex geometries. At the same union force range it is 50% cheaper than the vacuum alternative and 80% cheaper than the electromagnetic solution. At a same range piece of high complexity, due to TGRIP requires less fixture equipment and machining steps, it is 70% cheaper than the mechanical clamping systems.'\n'",
