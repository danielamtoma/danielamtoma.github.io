    "objective": "We will do to estate agents what Opodo did to travel agents, eBay did to secondhand shops, and Airbnb is doing to hotels. By getting rid of the middleman in favour of a peer-to-peer participatory model, we will bring the property market in line with the changing needs of society and the rapid pace of technology. Our solution is a technology platform called Qoob that lets you rent property directly from your phone, making estate agents a thing of the past. Described by the Daily Mail as ëthe Tinder of propertyí, our platform makes property transactions cheaper, faster and globally consistent. It lets owners list their properties and tenants list their needs. Both can browse, make a match and exchange rent, even at short notice or for an undermined length of time. Our technology will reduce cost, increase flexibility and bring Europe-wide consistency to finding accommodation. By letting owners set their own terms, we will catalyse a market correction in which shorter and flexible tenancies are found in proportion to demand. Qoob is part of a paradigm shift from ownership to access, offering citizens a means of agile moving and renting.",
