    "startDate": "25/06/2018",
    "endDate": "24/06/2020",
    "objective": "Enhanced-MUMs targets the development of advanced multifunctional and low-cost polymeric membranes for water treatment and desalination. The main innovation resides in the combination of enhanced structural properties (high porosity and reinforcement) for improved desalination characteristics and light-induced antifouling and antimicrobial activity based on the loading of photosensitizers in the polymeric membrane. The economy of the approach is guaranteed by the polymeric material chosen for the realization of the membrane: PVC. The proposed breakthrough relies on the complementary expertise of the Experienced Researcher on polymer chemistry and nanofibers fabrication and of the supervisor√≠s group on polymeric materials characterization, photochemistry of organic materials and photosensitizers for photodynamic treatments. Enhanced-MUMs is a multidisciplinary project that aims at bringing high innovation in the forefront research area of water treatment and desalination. In the frame of the project the Experienced Researcher will widen her scientific skills and technological know-how with significant improvement for the development of her career.",
