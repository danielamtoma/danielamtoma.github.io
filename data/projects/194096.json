    "objective": "The primary objective of Do CHANGE is to develop a health ecosystem for integrated disease management of citizens with high blood pressure and patients with ischemic heart disease or heart failure. The system will give them access to a set of personalized health services in a near real-time fashion. This disruptive system will incorporate behavior change methods, such as ìDo Something Differentî, in conjunction with new innovative wearable/portable tools that can scan nature and volume of food and fluid intake, monitor behavior and clinical parameters in normal living situations. \nThe objectives will be achieved by empowering patients with (1) tools and services, made available on smartphone or tablet and (2) the full control over the personal data they share with carers. To that extend a cyclic co-design methodology with end-users and health care professionals will be followed during the entire project. \nAt the same time innovative end-user tools, including (1) a smart spatula for salt measurement, (2) a new artifact for fluid measurement and (3) a wearable food scan micro-spectrometer device, will be tested, (re-)designed and evaluated with patients and health professionals in Spain, NL and Taiwan. In view of the better balanced patient-care relationship, the traditional e-health telemonitoring will be enhanced with end-to-end trust assured transactions, secure storage, and ethical analytics of personal health data, making the patient an genuine stakeholder in his own cure processes and the ethical integration point of his own data. \nThe proposal will be highly relevant to PCH 26 (ii): citizensí life-style, socio-cultural values are continuously taken into account and a new range of mHealth tools is developed including a disruptive one from Taiwan. By providing concrete behavioral alternatives the new system will help patients to adhere to medical recommendations. Patient engagement and  sanitized data logistics are to lead to significant health cost reductions.",
