    "objective": "Here we propose a radically new way to control chemical reactions on the quantum level. The Experienced Researcher (ER) will combine his long-standing expertise on cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) with the field of ultracold chemical reactions, in which the host is one of the leading pioneers. We want to drive a photo-chemical reaction (photoassociation) within an optical cavity and in this way gain control over the reaction (objective 1). For this, we use the control over spontaneous photon emission by an optical cavity, as has been done with single atoms. This paves the way towards novel fascinating effects like superradiant chemistry, where a chemical process is enhanced due to quantum statistics. Furthermore, the optical cavity will be used as an ultrasensitive molecule detector of a new quality by detecting them without disturbing their quantum state (objective 2). This novel interdisciplinary combination of physics and chemistry will open up a new research field, where the ER will demonstrate scientific innovation and independence.",
