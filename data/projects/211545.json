    "objective": "WEGO (Well-being, Ecology, Gender and cOmmunity) is a trans-national network aims to develop a shared research and training agenda to educate the next generation of interdisciplinary social-environmental scientists on feminist political ecology in Europe. WeGOís research examines gender relations in community organizing from a feminist-informed political ecology (FPE) framework. From an international and interdisciplinary perspective, WEGO looks at gender and power relations in community responses to the current climate, economic and environmental crises in different socio-ecological contexts. WEGO aims to provide insightful and compelling analysis about the importance of gendered community response to climate, economic and environmental change as well as more detailed knowledge about what changes are required for greater resilience and sustainability. Gender is understood as a critical variable in shaping resource access and control, interacting with class, caste, race, culture, and ethnicity to shape processes of ecological change and the prospects of any community for sustainable development. WEGO research will look at resilience and sustainability by examining the gendered role of women in care work for the community and for the environment. The cases chosen ñ from in and outside of Europe are sites that can feed into innovative European Policy on sustainable development.",
