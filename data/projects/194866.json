    "startDate": "01/09/2015",
    "endDate": "31/08/2017",
    "objective": "The project aims to achieve the first in-depth study on the lyrical topos of loversí separation (i.e. when a lover has to go away and therefore leaves her/his beloved for some time) in the Italian Renaissance. The study is meant to improve our knowledge about: 1) the different ways to read and re-use the tradition in the Renaissance; 2) the role of Petrarch as an authority in Renaissance love literature, also in comparison to other models; 3) the interaction between lyrics and love treatises, as well as between literature and philosophy in the conception and representation of love in the Renaissance. For such a goal, Dr. Favaro will analyze the topos of loversí separation in Renaissance lyrics and love treatises, paying attention to their mutual interaction, as well as to the relationship with the previous literary tradition and with philosophical sources (especially Neoplatonism). He will also achieve the commented editions of two little-known Renaissance dialogues entirely devoted to the subject of loversí separation.",
