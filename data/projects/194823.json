    "objective": "This project examines the telework effects on environment and labour market outcomes. More specifically, the first aim of the project is to analyse the link between job satisfaction, labour productivity and firm performance. The second aim is to examine the effects of teleworking on labour productivity/job satisfaction and environment (e.g. traffic, air pollution).  The final aim of this study is to examine how teleworking affects the labour market and housework division between men and women. Two databases are used; the Workplace Employment Relations Survey (WERS) and British Household Panel Survey (BHPS). Various econometric techniques are applied, such as Fixed Effects and Dynamic Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM) models Instrumental Variables (IV) and Generalized Latent Class Ordered Probit Models, Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SURE) and Three Stage Least Squares (3SLS).",
