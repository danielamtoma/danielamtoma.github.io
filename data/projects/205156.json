    "objective": "The overall objective of the SAFECHILD project is to significantly improve children√≠s safety when they are transported on private vehicles. SAFECHILD will launch the production and sale of a new SAFECHILD Child Restraint System (CRS) that offers better protection than any other device available in the market. This new safety system meets the applicable UN/ECE Regulations 129 and goes further by setting the basis for a new standard in protecting the youngest passengers. The sequential ambition of the company leading this project (IDAP Technology) is to create a new brand of CRS, to approach car Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) in order they include the new CRS solution in their portfolios of safety systems and, finally, to become main manufacturer of CRS solutions for those third parties. Summarizing, the current SMEs Instrument project will allow to perform appropriated market research and define in detail SAFECHILD Business Plan, to create strong presence on the Internet and to enlarge selling opportunities from the on-line mass market to, for instance, the car OEMs.",
