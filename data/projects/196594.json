    "objective": "The objective of this project is the creation of Wavegardens all around the world. A Wavegarden is a place where surfers can practice surf: a lagoon in which a mechatronic device creates waves that could fulfil surfers expectations. According to the report ìBlue Growth Scenarios and drivers for Sustainable Growth from the Oceans, Seas and Coasts, Third Interim Report, March 2012ì an important niche in coastline tourism is represented by nautical sports. For example, 10 million people in the world travel each year to wind and wave surfing destinations and the trend is growing, and 500 thousand more people every year practice this sport. Surfing is ranked in the top 20 most popular and fastest growing sports in all countries, cultures and demographics. The surfing industry, with an economic impact in the range of US$100 billion, is estimated to continue its growth in the years to come. The ëstokeí, or feeling, of surfing, which has been limited to the lucky few who live near quality surfing waves, is now accessible to everyone thanks to Wavegarden.",
