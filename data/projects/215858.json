    "objective": "The overall objective of Piql-GO is to upscale, pilot, and commercialise our disruptive and migration-free Piql System & Services for ultra-secure and long-term preservation of digital and analogue data, guaranteeing data authenticity and integrity for 500\\ years. We have converted photosensitive film into a self-contained and migration free digital preservation medium (ëbits-on-filmí), stored as a very high resolution 2D QR-codes, with a longevity of 500\\ years, all integrated into a standard IT environment. Piql is the only solution allowing to store both, visual and digital information.\n\nIn the Piql-GO Phase 2 project we will address and implement the findings of our SME Phase 1 (GA#674422) to enable rapid and successful commercialisation of our Services. We have outlined a series of specific objectives (grouped in 3 categories) and achieving them will bring us to a wide global market uptake:\n1) Technology maturation objectives will optimise Piql System functionalities prior to piloting by end-clients. Objective to raise the TRL of our technology from its current TRL7 to 8 (WP1).\n2) Pilot & validation objectives to demonstrate and validate the commercial potential of Piql Services in real-operation environment supervised by 7 potential end-clients (i.e. The Vatican Library & Walt Disney) representing 6 targeted market segments across 6 target countries. The piloting activities will elevate Piql System from TRL8 to 9 (WP2).\n3) Market maturation, communication and innovation management objectives enabling us to successfully bring Piql Services to the market and reach sales traction beyond Phase 2 (WP4-6).\n\nThrough Piql-GO we will boost our growth - quantified as accrued revenues exceeding Ä183.9m 5-year post-project with accrued net earn. of more than Ä122.8m and job creation of at least 90 FTEs at Piql and 245 in our value chain. Finally, we will enable cost savings for end-clients equal to accrued NPV of Ä1.37bn on 15 years and Ä3.38bn on 100 years.",
