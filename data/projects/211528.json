    "objective": "In this Proof-of-Concept project we will demonstrate the practical feasibility of a fundamentally novel transparent and\nflexible Li-organic thin-film microbattery. The strong basis for the project is the new hybrid Li-organic electrode materials\ndiscovered in the PI's ERC Advanced Grant Project ìMolecular-Layer-Engineered Inorganic-Organic Hybrid Materials\n(LAYERENG-HYBMAT)î. These hybrid thin-film materials are fabricated by the combined atomic/molecular layer deposition\n(ALD/MLD) technique which uniquely allows for fabrication of highly conformal thin-film coatings on various flexible,\nsensitive, functional and/or nanostructured surfaces. Within this PoC project we will (1) design and construct an actual\noptimized all-ALD/MLD Li-organic battery cell, (2) confirm its optical transparency and mechanical flexibility as expected,\n(3) identify the most potential applications for this new type of 3D thin-film microbattery, (4) assess its real-life business\nopportunities, and (5) build up a network of academic and industrial collaborators for the further advancement of the novel\ntechnology.",
