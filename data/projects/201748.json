    "objective": "The innovative system will be able to interact on a single machine the processes of: (1) punching and forming sheet metal using mechanical tool, and (2) the cutting of sheet metal parts by means of a laser source with fiber of high brilliance. The metal plate being machined on the machine is being fed from coil, which is also loaded on a specific equipment, which composes the plant and allows the end user to work continuously in the sheet metal strip. A mechatronic actuator uses only power required to work to do, no positioning moves made at full power and therefore no waste of energy that becomes heat dissipated into the environment. Also, there are not liquid pollutants such us hydraulic oil or lubrication. - Performance improved for each industrial process High energy savings- up to 50% to standard punching technologies.",
