    "objective": "POLYSOLAR Short Summary\n\nEstablished in 2009 in Berlin, Germany, Solardynamik provides renewable energy consulting services, conducts researches and develops innovative solutions for the solar PV sector. We have developed, patented and demonstrated an innovative, light-weight, tracking support system for solar PV modules based on a recyclable, inflatable polymer membrane. Support systems are used to hold solar modules in place and may be either fixed-tilt or tracking types. Tracking types orient PV modules toward the sun to improve efficiency.\n\nThe main advantages of the system are: Up to 68% less cost than SoA and 70% lighter; Up to 30% more annual energy production than fixed-axis solutions; Compact and light weight - cost effective transport and installation, can be used on wider range of light weight structures; Can fully deflate under wind loads ñ suitable for use in hurricane prone regions; Up to 44% less CO2 emission in manufacture; Transparent body provides architectual advantages, allows light penetration when mounted as a lattice or when used with semi-transparent solar cells, lighting applications; 100% recyclable, and future polymers from renewable sources; Dual use of land with exisiting agricultual or other activity (eg carport).\n\nWe expect to enter the market in 2017, after securing external funding of around Ä2.2 million. and predict a total net income in the range of Ä4.29 million over a 5-year period. Additionally we create 38 new positions in our company over that period.\n\nIn Phase 1 our objectives are: 1.) to analyse the results of the prototype demonstration to identify potential improvements; 2.) to identify potential manufacturers of the system components; 3.) to further assess and protect our intellectual property; 4.) to perform a detailed study of the target markets; 5.) to identify and assess potential distribution partners in Europe and abroad.",
