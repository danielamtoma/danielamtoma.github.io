    "objective": "The power dynamics and the effects of gender on social, spatial and political behaviour have regained major interest in public debates in the last years. If media (and new media) play an important role in relaying this debate, it does also in producing and reinforcing normative gendered practices. In response to the incapacity of mainstream media to induce effective change, video and digital artists explore the technological and political possibilities of digital media, video art and virtual reality to transform gendered norms affirmatively; that is creating alternative futures to the status quo rather than lamenting the current situation. Calling for a post-cinematic spectator, both individualised and participative, video and digital artists produce new genres and formats through which they express affirmative responses to gender and power. Building a bridge between film theory, new immersive media and social engagement, this research project will investigate how post-cinematic arts produce micropolitical instances of activism through narrative and aesthetic experiences.",
