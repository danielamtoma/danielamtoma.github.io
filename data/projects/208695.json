    "objective": "The GOSSAN  project will provide a full and accurate study on  the geochemical, morphological and structural composition of iron oxides and  oxyhydroxide compounds, The attention will be focalized on  goethite in different types of Supergene Ore deposits (SOD). More precisely, it is aimed to investigate the  concentration, structural position and cationic exchange and  economic potential of goethite as an unconventional source of ìCritical Elementsî (CE).\nFurthermore, the behaviour of the the goethite precursor phase (ferrihydrite) will be documented by assessment of the ions behaviour during maturation and transformation to goethite and finally hematite.  \nThe project will be developed in two years in which the reseacher will examine the mineralogy and geochemistry of many supergene samples of the NHM collections by the useof the analytical facilities provided by NHM.  Ion exchange reactions will be assessed by experimental tests while the geochemical uptake of metallic trace elements will be studied by the use of TEM and Synchrotone XAS techniques. Furthermore, metallurgical treatments will be carried out on selected natural metal-bearing goethite specimens from different SOD in order to study the potential recovery of the metals trapped in the structure to assess the economic potential of iron oxides and oxyhdroxides.\nThe project also comprises a well-defined plan of training activities for the researcher in order to enhance its skills and help him to develop its future career as  researcher.",
