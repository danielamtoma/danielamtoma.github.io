    "objective": "The aim of this proposal is to aid Dynavio Cooperative in the recruitment and development of its collaboration with an highly skilled specialist combining rare competences in mathematics' formal logic and computing science at a doctoral level. This recruitment should support the development of its promising products in the field of automatic requirement design extraction and analysis. The products developed by Dynavio automate knowledge intensive but routine document analysis tasks for allowing the highly skilled, well-paid engineering specialists to allocate their time for tasks that create higher value for the company, and that are more fulfilling for the individual.\nFormal logic in mathematics is an approach having the potential to detect contradictions between requirements. Detecting those contradictions at early stage is providing a huge support to design and develop better complex systems. Dynavio's requirement extractor and analysis product is not yet capable of discovering all those complex contradictions. The support of a formal logic specialist having excellent programming skills will support this development. Currently we have not been able to find such specialist on our national labor market.",
