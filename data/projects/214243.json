    "objective": "EXTRUSION IN MOTION, LLC  (EIM) aims to commercialize its innovative ìPassive and Active Acoustic Leak Detection (PAALD)î system which can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of the detection of leaks of liquids in pipelines and storage tanks, helping to avoid associated environmental and economic damages to its users and the society overall. The detection of crude oil and petroleum products leaks has been selected as an introductory application, however the applicability of PAALD will be further enhanced to non-petroleum hazardous liquids transported by pipelines, as well as water. The novelty of the suggested solution derives from a unique fusion of two leak detection methods ñ i.e. the rarefaction wave and acoustic emission - which ensures high sensitivity with minimized false positive alarms, as well as higher cost-effectiveness of PAALD, compared to the competition.",
