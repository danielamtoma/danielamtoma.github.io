    "objective": "OPERAS-D (Design) project will support the 5 main partners (ìcore groupî) of the OPERAS network in the development of a European e-infrastructure for open access publications in the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH). The project will address long-term requirements for the development of the e-infrastructure and community building, as well as seek to expand other interested parties within and beyond Europe, and in diverse fields of the SSH. \nTo achieve this goal, the key objectives of the OPERAS-D project are to:\n-prepare a design study that defines governance models, structures and scientific and technical concepts for future services that the infrastructure will provide, and establishes a roadmap to achieve these goals according to the requirements for long term sustainability .\n-engage the current and future partners in the OPERAS network to strengthen the community and develop the network of partners participating in OPERAS across Europe, specifically in central European countries. \nThe project will establish a roadmap for OPERAS consortium that includes e-infrastructure service providers (publishing platforms, libraries) and research and education communities (universities and university presses). It will define long term requirement by producing a user driven design for future services and the technical requirements to implement them and also a final governance model and business plan for OPERAS development.\nThe community building will help all participants in OPERAS to have a clear picture of their technical environment and a better understanding of the different technical options within the community. It will gather all stakeholders in workshops to validate data collected during the project and to share the results and the vision for the development of the infrastructure.\nOperas-D will identify key stakeholders inside and outside Europe and engage them for potential collaboration with OPERAS.",
