    "startDate": "01/08/2018",
    "endDate": "31/07/2020",
    "objective": "This research project deals with the phenomenon of translation in order to investigate its philosophical structure, logic and character and thus to contribute to the affirmation and development of the philosophy of translation as a relevant research discipline. The research proposes a conception of translation as a self-reflexive transformational practice, investigating at the same time importance and effectiveness of translation in the contemporary European political and cultural context. The interdisciplinary character of the project requires a combination of philosophy, translation studies, cultural theory and political theory. The research aims to have a broad impact and takes into account the practical effectiveness of its main ideas for addressing some of the current social and political issues in Europe. The proposal includes training-through-research at the participating organisations, acquirement of new experiences and skills, a two-way-transfer of knowledge, teaching, organization of a workshop, participation in conferences, and planning for publications. Results will be disseminated to the academic community of experts and to the wider audience as well. The project is in line with the key priorities of the Horizon 2020 Work Programmes 2016-17 and 2018-20, i.e., with the integration of social sciences and humanities in promoting the European Public and Cultural Space.",
