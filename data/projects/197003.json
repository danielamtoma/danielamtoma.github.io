    "objective": "OKIDOKEYS is a new system to unlock your home or garage door by using a smartphone or other several devices. The system will allow the user to install it in a few minutes with no need of changing the door lock.\nThe system interacts with both an Okidokeys app-enabled smartphone (iOS and Android) as well as a number of different fobs. As an alternative to smartphones e-key, OpenWays also offers keyfobs, walletcard-tags and wristband-tags.\nOkidokeys has recently started a market test in the USA with very good acceptance; the objective of this project is to validate and demonstrate the new system for the European requirements that will require getting over several challenges.\nIn the last 50 years the lock / key industry has not innovated very much:\n- Using metal keys could cause problems if they are lost\n- Metal keys are difficult to dispatch, remove or cancel.\n- Metal keys have limited security\n- Metal keys are expensive. (New securing locks have more expensive keys)\nOkidokeys will eliminate all those problems by the use of smart keys ìinstalledî in a smart-phone, cell-phone, keychain, wristband, walletcard tags integrating Bluetooth 4.0, CAC (Crypto Acoustic Credentials), RFID and NFC technologies.",
