    "objective": "Linkker has developed total cost of ownership (TCO) optimized concept for electrification of city bus systems. Linkker solutions are lightweight city bus, energy efficient battery electric vehicle systems (BEV system) and conversion kits for bus retrofits.\n\nObjective of 1st phase of commercialization is to study commercial potential of energy efficient bus system developed by Linkker in European cities. Speed up roll-out of energy efficient electric bus systems in a few selected cities in Europe for reduced emissions and lower TCO (Total Cost of Ownership). Faster transition will help cities achieve cost savings for public transportation quicker, reduce emissions faster and finally accelerate electric bus activities by European industry. This is our focus in Phase 1. \n\nLong term objective is together with cities and bus operators to increase attractiveness of public transport with sustainable electric buses, which offer superior user experience.",
