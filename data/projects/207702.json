    "objective": "The objective of this project is to design and test a highly efficient automated and/or assisted process for the layup operation of the manufacturing of composite stiffeners, with a competitive cost advantage comparing to the current hand lay-up process.\n\nDifferent process/cell architecture will be study during the preliminary design review (as DFP, AFP, Pick and place, NCF)  and consolidated by preliminary trials if necessary to select a process with the topic manager witch will devellopped in critical design review and test during trials and parts manufacturing step.\n\nFour full scale composites parts will be manufactured and tested thanks to laboratory cell to demonstrate the maturity level of the process proposed.\n\nA mass projection study will be realized to consolidate the prospective of the process tested and approved in serial production (production capabilities, RC/NRC)",
