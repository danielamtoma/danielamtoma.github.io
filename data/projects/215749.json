    "objective": "Herein, we propose to design de novo (ìfrom scratchî) the first upconverting metalloprotein. This will be achieved by\nexploiting a new class of lanthanide coiled coils (LCC), to generate bimetallic derivatives. These will, for the first time,\ncombine the attractive photophysical properties of Ln complexes, with de novo designed coiled coil scaffolds capable of\nselectively binding different Ln ions at well-defined and tuneable distances. This programme of work will provide a new\nstrategy for unlocking the full potential of science at the interface of biology and inorganic chemistry, by combining previously\nunexplored ligands with traditional inorganic complexes, for applications beyond those offered by biology, such as\nupconversion. The complementary expertise of Dr Sinha (bioinorganic synthesis and computational modeling) and the\nsupervisor Dr Peacock (metallopeptide design) offer the unique combination to realise the full potential of multimetallic\nLCCs, and will, in conjunction with two planned short secondments, provide Dr Sinha with new and cutting-edge research\ntraining.",
