    "objective": "HYDRONIT is a company established in 2003 whose core business focuses on research, development and production of smart modular hydraulic power packs and relevant components for the mobile industry, for which we strive for excellence. We operate in 50\\ countries with daughter companies located in China, the UK and the US. Our passion for hydraulics power and our commitment with our customers let us reach Ä4 million turnover in 2015, 60% of which coming from exports (as of 2016Q2, we project 10% growth for 2016, which will let us achieve Ä4.4 million turnover).Hydronit has always pursued a full new concept of hydraulics consisting on building modular solutions that integrates all necessary pieces of knowledge (electric/electronics on top of hydraulics), removing the need to resort to multiple subcontracts to produce the final equipment. Following this philosophy, we have been developing MIDRAULICS, a programmable intelligent mini and micro power pack for the mobile industry (e.g. industrial, construction and agricultural vehicles and equipment). MIDRAULICS will provide our customers in the mobile application sector: 1. Full control  distribution of hydraulics (100% compared to conventional systems with no integrated control); 2. Total safety thanks to a better control of the solution components and power; 3. Huge energy saving, as a results of the following factors: 86% less material for wiring; 10 % electric power savings in on-off applications thanks to start stop features; 30% electric power savings in variable speed applications through use of Inverters and AC motors.4. Environmental friendliness, thanks to Metal reduction (no need for sensor housing) and Cable reduction (through use of wireless communications) Thanks to MIDRAULICS, we expect to generate about Ä6.87 million accumulative revenues during the first 5 years of business (conservative scenario), achieving a RoI ? 1.58.",
