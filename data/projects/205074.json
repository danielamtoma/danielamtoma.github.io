    "objective": "Today there are no holistic temperature logger solutions capable of following individual temperature sensitive products from production to consumption. The reasons are mainly costs and lack of efficiency. We are therefore developing a low cost RFID Temperature Logger Label. The lowest price on temperature loggers among competitors today is approximately Ä20 per unit. We intend to offer our label to the marked for Ä1.5 per unit at rollout, and Ä0.75 per unit within two years. This label will become part of our total solution consisting of an online database, mobile apps, and handheld or portal readers with read distance up to several meters. Today temperature data from temperature loggers are mainly manually collected. With wireless read distance up to several meters, it is possible to read logger labels on an entire pallet by passing through a portal with RFID readers installed.",
