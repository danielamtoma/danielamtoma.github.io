    "objective": "Large corporations dominate the food retail and wholesale industry in Europe. Supp.li is a multi-sided online platform, with the objective to liberate the foodservice market as Uber or Airbnb did with their specific industries. It provides for all HORECA sellers, buyers and transporters an equal and open service that speeds up their go-to-market activities domestically and internationally, helps them reach more consumers with lower costs, finalize the selling/shipping/buying interactions faster with less interim costs. It also makes software supported business intelligence data widely available for them vs. zero or only semi-digital distribution options.\n\nSupp.li in Phase 1 will prepare the feasibility assessment that will validate the further development in terms of business and technical viability, also by involving HORECA buyers, sellers and transporters.",
