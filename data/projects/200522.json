    "objective": "SEPPELEC, S.L. is an engineering company, we are specialists in process engineering for drink factories and facilities. The ultimate goal we seek in ASEPTIC-VACBID project is to develop an automatic and aseptic equipment to empty concentrated juices out of aseptic bags. We have already developed a semi-automatic prototype achieving aseptic conditions to empty bags up to 25L. The objective of this project is to scale-up the aseptic system in a complete automatic equipment to empty the standard 250L and 1,500L bags used in the juice industry. By incorporating an ASEPTIC-VACBID system into the production process, capable to empty 18,000L of concentrate per hour, the juice industry will reduce energy consumption costs of Ã„150,000 per year (1.324.422 kW), representing an improvement of 13% in the energy efficiency of the whole process. The use of water is reduced by 30.000L per hour and the automated equipment also reduce personal costs.",
