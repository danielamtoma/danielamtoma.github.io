    "objective": "Spatial navigation requires the integration of visual and vestibular inputs to build a representation of space. Connectivity studies have shown that the secondary visual cortex (V2) of mice receives bottom-up inputs from primary visual cortex and anterior thalamus, conveying respectively visual and vestibular information, and feedback top-down inputs from the retrosplenial cortex. \nThe aims of this project are to determine the visual and vestibular tuning of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in V2, how these inputs are recruited and interact when the mouse is engaged in a spatial navigation task, and how they are modulated by retrosplenial inputs. This will be accomplished using a combination of population calcium imaging or whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of layer 5 neurons, coupled with sensory stimulation and optogenetic activation or inhibition of sensory or top-down inputs and behavioural experiments.",
