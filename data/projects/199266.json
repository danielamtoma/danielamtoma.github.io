    "objective": "The main objective of this innovation project is to refine, scale up and bring to market readiness a user-centric ICT decision support system (CleanPEA) that makes use of an innovate four-tier business model involving corporate fleet owners, vehicle drivers, EV manufacturers and infrastructure providers. CleanPEA will purpose it to support and encourage corporate fleet owners/operators to make the change from diesel-/petrol-powered, Light Commercial Vehicles (LCV ñ cars and vans) to the Electric Vehicles (EVs) equivalent. This will help the EU meet its demanding CO2 emission reduction targets, as cars and vans contribute around 15% of all CO2 emissions across Europe . Fleet Innovations Ltd. (FLEET) is an ambitious, Innovative-Driven Enterprise (IDE) with a strong desire to internationalise their business and led by a team of experts and serial entrepreneurs in providing data capture/reporting technology systems and fleet management solutions to track corporate business mileage/journey data. While engaging in customer building activities for our current solution (PEAK Miles), we discovered a strong desire among commercial corporations with company LCV fleets to switch to EVs as a way of cutting their cost and meeting their carbon reduction obligations . Europeís corporate fleets produce around 380Mt CO2 emission annually, accounting for around 8% of all EU emissions . We have conservatively estimated that the successful commercialisation of CleanPEA will allow us to generate new cumulative revenues and profits respectively of Ä94.32m and Ä57.55m (EBITDA) 6 years post project (2022). As a result, we would create 91 new jobs across Europe and directly contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions by 609,780 tonnes.",
