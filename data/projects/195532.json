    "objective": "The mouse embryo is an excellent model for human development. Its preimplantation stages of development in vitro have been extensively studied. Now similar approaches can be applied to implantation stages, previously hidden from view in the uterus. It was recently revealed that formation of a rosette structure by pluripotent epiblast cells can be recapitulated by ES cells cultured in extracellular matrix proteins. I will determine the extent to which such rosettes can undertake autonomous development or if they require flanking extraembryonic tissues. I will characterise the patterns of the normal development of these tissues from the point of implantation to the time of gastrulation. I will determine the extent to which explants of extraembryonic tissues can influence the development of rosettes of epiblast cells. Altogether, these experiments will expand our knowledge of embryonic development and how to manipulate the developmental potential of pluripotent cells.",
