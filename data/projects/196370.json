    "objective": "Adult articular cartilage has a limited capacity for repair so when damaged it can lead to joint degeneration and ultimately osteoarthritis. In our lab we have had significant success in enhancing tissue regeneration by functionalising collagen-based scaffolds for the delivery of therapeutic genes. In this project we propose to apply this concept for the delivery of microRNAs to promote enhanced cartilage repair.",
