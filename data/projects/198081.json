    "objective": "Graphene's unique electrical and optical properties make it ideal for a variety of applications, in particular for flexible (opto)electronic devices, such as mobile phones, tablets etc. Current flexible electronic devices are based on organic semiconducting materials with excellent current switching but poor charge carrier mobility, which result in a slow response. HiGRAPHINK aims to unlock this limitation by demonstrating the viability of graphene as additive to printed organic semiconducting materials, aiming to improve their mobility. The devices will be made into flexible active matrix arrays to drive proof of concept Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) displays. Combining graphene and organic semiconducting materials may significantly improve the performance of flexible active matrix arrays, enabling a range of foldable and portable consumer electronic devices",
