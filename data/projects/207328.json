    "objective": "Recently developed experimental techniques for cooling, trapping and localizing atoms near nanostructures, such as one-dimensional nanoscopic waveguides, offer a new paradigm to investigate quantum light-matter interactions. Collective coherent effects in such engineered interfaces pave the way to integrated quantum technology applications, including single-photon sources and efficient quantum memory for light. The present project investigates this approach based on arrays of cold atoms trapped in the vicinity of a nanofiber. In parallel to experimental developments at the host, this project will develop the theoretical framework of photon scattering in commensurate and non-commensurate arrays and will include ab-initio microscopic description of the interaction. Bragg scattering and superradiance effect will be studied to obtain larger efficiency than previous ensemble-based implementations. Waveguide-mediated long-range organization of the array will also be investigated.",
