    "objective": "Guiding molecules/nanomaterials to the right place in plasmonic nanoantennas is a key problem to be solved in order to benefit from the high electromagnetic field localization offered by these materials. Accessing these nanoscale-regions remains a significant challenge in plasmonics and is the main goal of this project. The novel approach introduced here is based on the field-enhancement properties of the nanoantennas, thus spatially selective to the hot-spots. This easy, fast and cheap strategy can allow selective and large-scale positioning of any kind of molecules and/or nanomaterials in a variety of plasmonic-nanoantenna hot-spots, independently of their shape and resonance position. This strategy can solve the big challenge of hot-spot modification in plasmonic nanoantennas thus opening new doors to many real applications ranging from biosensing to energy conversion.",
