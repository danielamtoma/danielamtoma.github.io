    "objective": "The main objective of the MUPIA project is to demonstrate a cost-efficient manufacturing process for a high end MEMS gyroscope for aerospace Applications. Both the sensor element and the packaging process is critical to achieve a precise, long term stable and reliable component. The consortium consist of SINTEF and Cerinnov, which together with sub Suppliers cover both the necessary silicon MEMS processing and the high end ceramic packaging technology needed to reach the goal of the project. SINTEF has worked with industrialisation of MEMS components since the 1960s. Despite being a research industry, SINTEF holds the certifications ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015 and OHSAS 18001:2007 and have a regular production of MEMS components for the petroleum, medical and aerospace industry. Cerinnov has expertise in laser processes for ablation and sintering. They will collaborate with a sub Suppliers with the development of the package for the gyroscope.",
