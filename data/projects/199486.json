    "objective": "The objective of the project is to investigate the fatigue crack growth (FCG) threshold and rate for long as well as short cracks of second generation TiAl alloys suitable for use in the Intermediate Pressure Turbine (IPT) of the UltraFanTM engine. \n\nThe work includes in detail all investigations specified in the Call for Proposals JTI-CS2-2014-CFP01-ENG-03-04, that are:\n\nï\tdetermination of the FCG threshold and rates at load ratios R of 0.1, 0.5, 0.8 at room temperature and at 750 ∞C, \n\nï\tdetermination of the variation of these material properties at room temperature for three different heat treatments (centre and extremes of the heat treatment window) at load ratios R of 0.1, 0.5, 0.8, and\n\nï\tdetermination of the effect of defect type (defects from manufacturing, handling and foreign object damage (FOD)), morphology and size on the fatigue  properties at room temperature and at 750 ∞C at load ratios R of 0.1, 0.5, 0.8.",
