    "objective": "Covomo is a specialised insurance platform providing plans based on on-demand user-generated content. \n\nCovomo offers end-users the ability to insure the things they care about. Not to be constricted by pre-determined plans that don't cover the scenarios or objects deemed most important. The platform compares coverage plans from several insurers instantaneously, providing an objective and easy-to-purchase platform over mobile or web.\nCovomoís latest expansion to offer all forms of specialised insurance was based on the success of Covomoís original travel insurance comparator service. It had gained exceptionally positive traction, and importantly, an overwhelming response by brokerage organisations to expand to varying categories of specialised insurance. The current prototype platform has already received positive feedback and solid support from over 40 multi-national European insurers and over 275 European brokerages. \n\nThe proposed work in Phase 1 of the SME instrument fits into the overall plan to reach market by contributing the financial resources needed to plan a faster and wider deployment of Covomo and its market uptake, in the go-to market countries of Germany, France and Belgium.",
