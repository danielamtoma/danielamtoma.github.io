    "objective": "Design and synthesis of molecular materials whose physical properties can be controlled by external stimuli are of the most advanced research interests. In this project we aim to synthesize and study in-depth a family of molecular compounds with adjustable electronic properties based on an intramolecular electron transfer (ET) mechanism. The ET phenomenon defines two stable states that can be controlled by temperature, light, electric field, pressure or a chemical stimulus and can be used to design new molecular switches.\nFollowing an innovative bottom-up approach, we will generate a family of new switches from the association of donor (LFe(CN)x) and acceptor (LÃ­Co(solv)) building blocks. The obtained systems will be then associated within assemblies in order to produce functional networks with specific, sought-after electronic, optical and magnetic properties, such as photo-induced Single-Molecule Magnet behavior. The ET phenomenon has a high potential technological importance since the photo-induced changes in optical and magnetic properties could in principle allow the design of storage devices with exceptional high density.",
