    "objective": "The objective of the project is to develop new ways to implement quality validation of aircraft products in a more efficient manner, reducing non-recurring costs, reducing the need of man-hours and the involvement of manipulation by an human operator, reducing lead times and flexibility of the processes, through minimization of test means dependency trying to maximize the usage of the current Aircraft computers, and implementing new concepts for the automation of quality and validation tests on the aircraft, through artificial vision and robotic collaboration.",
