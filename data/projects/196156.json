    "objective": "The objective of the proposed project as a whole (phase 1-3) is to plan, develop, secure and bring to market an innovative non-toxic and eco-friendly self-polishing boat hull paint. In the proposed project Ekomarine Paint AB will introduce the patented non-toxic anti-fouling marine hull paint to the European and the global commercial shipping market and to the global leisure boat industry. The reason why Ekomarine Paint can do this, and no one else, is that the innovation is based on a patented technology and over 11 years of research (before year 2007 research had been performed in Ekomarine AB since 2003). Exactly what we wish to achieve through the project is to develop an optimized application for commercial vessels (which is a new market for the company) and a much improved application for leisure boats (partly existing customers). This will be achieved through a well-planned project plan where Ekomarine Paint will demonstrate in full scale and in real environment, in conjunction with potential customers, the functionality, economic and environmental benefits as well as working environment improvements in various geographical and meteorological settings. In terms of technology readiness level (TRL) we will move from TRL 6 towards TRL 9 during the project life-cycle.",
