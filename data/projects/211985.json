    "objective": "We aspire to build the smallest and most lightweight Raman spectrometer in the world, with a target size of 5x10x1 mm3 and a weight of only 0.1 g. The innovation builds on the combination of three key results of the ERC Advanced Grant project InSpectra (2011-2017): 1. Demonstration of Nanophotonic waveguide Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (NERS); 2. Demonstration of a novel on-chip Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS); 3. Demonstration of the integration of III-V light sources on a silicon platform through bonding or transfer printing technologies. By using a standard CMOS process toolset for fabricating the Raman spectrometer, a cost-effective and high yield product can be guaranteed with a price level at least an order of magnitude lower than current commercial systems. The exceptional form factor of the spectrometer will generate a rich variety of innovative applications of Raman spectroscopy. A spectrometer this small can be implanted, incorporated in smartphones or smartwatches and fits into textiles, drones etc. In this ERC PoC project, we will build this miniature spectrometer and use it for the target application of detecting volatile organic compounds (VOC) for personal safety monitoring, both at work and at home.",
