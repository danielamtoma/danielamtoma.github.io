    "objective": "The aim of this project is to use exchange of staff on an international and inter-sectoral basis to investigate the impact of consumption of novel nature-identical RRR-?-tocopherol in animal models on nutritional quality of animal-derived foods and in human models on bioavailability and circulating stereoisomers, and in doing so to foster a culture of research and innovation that will underpin new innovative products, services and processes in the area of animal and human nutrition. Vitamin E is represented by a suite of 8 compounds Ã± 4 tocopherols (?, ?, ?, ?) and 4 tocotrienols (?, ?, ?, ?).  The main function of vitamin E is as an anti-oxidant, preventing free radical-mediated lipid oxidation, particularly of membranal lipids. ?-Tocopherol is the most biologically active form  but ?-tocopherol itself exists in 8 stereoisomeric forms arising from the 3 chiral centres it contains, RRR, RRS, RSR, RSS, SSS, SSR, SRS and SRR.  Of these RRR-?-tocopherol is the most biologically active form.",
