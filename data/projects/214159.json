    "objective": "PhiloMagic is an interdisciplinary project in philosophical aesthetics in the analytic tradition. It focuses primarily on the art of theatrical magic (think David Copperfield, not Harry Potter), which the American Society for Aesthetics recognizes as a ìneglected art.î PhiloMagic builds on my prize-winning essay, ìThe Experience of Magic,î which is the first systematic philosophical treatment of theatrical magic in the analyticóor, to my knowledge, anyótradition. For my fellowship, I propose a 24-month stay at the Centre for Philosophical Psychology at the University of Antwerp under the supervision of Professor Bence Nanay. While in Antwerp, my main objectives are to complete a book manuscript (entitled *The Art of the Impossible*), write and submit for publication three accompanying scholarly articles, and organize a series of four study groups (each culminating in a public lecture) as well as an international workshop in the philosophy and psychology of magic.",
