    "objective": "The overall aim of  MOBISTYLE  is to raise consumer awareness and awareness of ownership, thus empowering consumers and providing confidence of choosing the right thing, by providing attractive tailor-made combined knowledge services on energy use, indoor environment, health and lifestyle, by ICT-based solutions. This awareness will support and motivate end-users to well informed pro-active behavior towards energy use, energy efficiency and health.\nThe objectives are:\n1. To make energy use and energy efficiency understandable and easy to handle in an attractive way by unlocking and translating large data sets using data science from energy monitoring for consumers.\na.\tTo transform ëbig dataí into ësmart dataí, i.e. giving meanings to data, making data understandable and findable.\nb.\tTo develop easy to use, desirable ICT-based tools which will make energy monitoring a well-accepted and attractive ëdaily activityí for end-users as well as for professionals (building managers). \n2. To provide understandable information to consumers on health and life style in relation to energy use by combining energy monitoring with monitoring indoor environmental and behavior parameters  \na.\tTo combine the several  low-cost, non-intrusive devices and monitoring with the energy monitoring. \nb.\tTo offer the end user transparency on energy use/efficiency, indoor environment, health and lifestyle. \n3. To motivate behavioral change of consumers/energy end-users by combined  modular information on energy use, health and lifestyle: To transform this information into knowledge for raising awareness on energy use and behavior, thus motivating and supporting to come to a behavioral consciousness and change of lifestyle concerning energy and health. \n4.
