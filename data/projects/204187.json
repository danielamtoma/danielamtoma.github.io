    "objective": "The purpose of Hy-MAC is to assess both technical and economic viability of using magnetic nanocomposites based on the combination of carbon nanoforms (graphene) with magnetic nanoparticle  as hybrid supercapacitors. These hybrid magnetic materials have shown to exhibit unique supercapacitive properties, which can be significantly enhanced by application of an external magnetic field. Thus, the specific capacitance increases up to a 500% by applying an external magnetic field. Taking advantage of these results, in this proposal we plan to fabricate and test prototype supercapacitive devices exhibiting better performances than those reported for commercial supercapacitors.",
