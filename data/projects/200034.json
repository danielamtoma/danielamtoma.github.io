    "objective": "The overall aim of this project is to create an International Network for Comparative Analysis of Social Inequalities (INCASI) with 19 universities, 10 from Europe and 9 from Latin America. The purpose is to conduct comparative research in the area of social inequalities. Through this network we hope to foster a space for collective reflection and the development of synergies between network partners that allow us to undertake innovative studies whose outputs have an impact on academic and policy debates on the subject. The project will also contribute to informing the design of public policies to tackle social inequalities. In so doing, we aim to contribute innovative solutions that improve citizensí living standards, reduce social inequalities and promote social justice. This is in line with Horizon 2020ís objectives.\n\nFrom this perspective, the whole project is structured on the basis of the following four pillars:\n1) Substantive background and explanatory models of social inequalities which comprises eight thematic axes integrated in a model of analysis called AMOSIT (Analytical Model of Social Inequalities and Trajectories).\n2) Methodology for the analysis of social inequalities\n3) Social policies to counteract social inequalities\n4) Gender inequalitiesí transversal perspective\n  \nTo achieve our objectives we organize the proposal chronologically through five work packages: \n1) Compilation: to review the accumulated scientific capital that exists among networkís members. \n2) Construction: AMOSIT model.\n3) Innovation: to propose a new theoretical and methodological perspective on social inequalities.\n4) Projection: to planning the sustainability of the network through two specific lines of action in research and teaching, and to disseminating-communicating project outcomes.\n5) Management: Organization and coordination of INCASI network activities.",
