    "objective": "In Europe more than 600,000 people are disabled in their natural mobility but are able and need to drive since they are of employment age: we want to bring to them an innovative independent mobility solution that overcomes the limitations of the devices currently available. By using robotics-based technology, our solution will allow the disabled person to use his electric wheelchair as a driver's seat in his car, without any intervention or assistance required of third parties while getting into and out of the car, in this way fully achieving his freedom of movement. Our innovation provides the disabled with total independence, greater comfort and saving two-thirds of the equivalent average expenditure incurred today. Our solution has been designed as original equipment to be installed by carmakers, just as it can be installed in a car one already owns: it is the first sustainable standardisation solution for disabled people in the automotive sector.",
