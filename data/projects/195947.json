    "objective": "ARVC is a hereditary disease mainly characterised by the progressive substitution of the myocardium with fatty or fibro-fatty tissue involving predominantly the right ventricle. Clinically, ARVC shows wide variation between individuals. Together with modifier genes, common sequence variants, and environmental as well as endogenous factors, epigenetic modifiers such as miRNAs are hypothesized to be potential targets for disadvantageous environmental stimuli and may lead to the onset of complex and heterogeneous diseases such as ARVC. The main research objective of this EF is to assess and validate the relevance of disease mechanisms underlying the development of ARVC and to identify novel RNA-based targets in mouse models and ARVC patients. The EF programme comprises two tightly linked components Ã± research and complementary training - that will be complemented with secondments in two (non-) academic organisations active in the field of molecular cardiology. The host organisations are strongly committed to enhancing the creative and innovative potential of the ER who wishes to diversify her individual competence in terms of skill acquisition to become a successful European scientist.",
