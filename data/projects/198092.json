    "endDate": "31/08/2018",
    "objective": "'Despite major technological development and the start of commercial deployments of the fuel cells and hydrogen technology, the public awareness of FCH technologies has lagged behind this technical progress so far, restricting the appetite of potential customers and risking a lack of support from policymakers. \nTo address this challenge, a consortium of leading experts has come together, combining communication experts, PR of established manufacturers and technology suppliers and world-class experts on the societal benefits of low carbon technologies. Together, the they will deliver HY4ALL, an ambitious programme to drive a step-change in awareness and excitement around fuel cells and hydrogen and deliver clear and consistent messages that resonate with all audiences, from policymakers to the general public. The project will be active in minimum 11 member states, and will be closely linked to the large numbers of existing hydrogen initiatives and demonstrations, maximising its impact and allowing the communication strategy to influence dissemination work beyond the project for lasting effects.\nThe project aims will be delivered through the following activities:\nï Development of an overarching communication strategy, that will form the basis for all subsequent project activities and will allow the FCH community to speak with ëone voiceí\nï Creation of an interactive web portal for FCH technologies, providing a ëone stop shopí for visitors seeking information and acting as a single brand and hub for all other dissemination activities\nï A cross-European 'hydrogen for society' roadshow with fuel cell vehicles travelling between cities across the EU. The roadshow will form the focal point for a variety of innovative dissemination activities, public debates, co-hosting of national vehicle and infrastructure launches\nï A robust assessment of of the macro-economic and societal benefits of FCH technologies, providing fact-based analysis used to convey clear messages\n'",
