    "objective": "The research proposal focuses on the study of the interaction between individuals' accessibility in contemporary institutions and their Social Capital (SC). The main premise of the proposal is that alienation from formal institutions creates a form of SC that works in a substitutive rather than a complementary way with the institutions and does not necessarily have positive societal externalities. In the first phase of the fellowship, a multi-disciplinary and innovative methodology will be applied in order to determine the exact conditions under which this form of SC is being developed and to measure the externalities it yields in a societal level.  The second phase of the fellowship is devoted in exploring the implications of the results for local governance policy-making. In particular, it involves disseminating the findings and insights of the study to a Think Tank whose objective is advising local government councils.",
