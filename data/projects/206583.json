    "objective": "The overall objective of B-SMART is: 1. to design modular nanoparticles, 2. to manufacture them via a quality-by-design protocol, 3. to achieve delivery of therapeutic RNAs to the brain and treat neurodegenerative diseases. \n\nI.\tTo design modular nanoparticles consisting of \no\tan active RNA payload\no\testablished (lipid-based), emerging (trigger-responsive polymer-based) or exploratory (extracellular vesicle-based) nanoparticles\no\ta targeting ligand  consisting of the variable domain of heavy chain only antibodies (also known as VHHs or nanobodies), which are coupled to the carrier platform\n\nII.\tTo manufacture the modular nanoparticles using a microfluidic assembly system that will ensure quality-by-design: uniform nanoparticles across research sites and excellent control over the physico-chemical parameters.  \n\nIII.\tTo test pre-clinical activity of formulations with promising in vitro activity with good cell/blood compatibility and to select the best RNA-formulation for clinical translation to treat neurodegenerative diseases.\nPre-clinical efficacy is tested after\no    local injection \no    nasal administration\no    systemic administration\nThe neurodegenerative diseases carry a high burden for patients since they are without exception progressive. But they also carry a substantial socio-economic burden with estimated costs of 130 billion euro. per year (2008).\n\nIV.\tThe technical work in B-SMART will be supported by project management. It ensures that the project is coordinated in a clear, unambiguous and mutually acceptable manner and that the project achieves its objectives, within the given financial and time constraints.\n\nin B-SMART we expect to arrive at a scale-able nanoparticle formulation with uniform characteristics that shows strong pre-clinical evidence of therapeutic efficacy and is ready for clinical translation.",
