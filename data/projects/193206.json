    "title": "2014-2015 Researchers' Night: The Greek events",
    "startDate": "01/06/2014",
    "endDate": "30/11/2015",
    "objective": "ReN2014-5 events will be organized during 2014 and 2015 and will take place in six major cities: i) Athens, Greeceís capital, ii) Thessaloniki, iii) Patras, iv) Heraklion, v) Volos and for the first time in vi) Corfu, the capital of the Ionian Islands. These cities are spread almost nation-wide and cover more than two-thirds of Greeceís total population ensuring a first-hand experience of ReN2014-5 activities from a large audience.\nThe consortium consists of prestigious universities and research centres which over the years have built extended networks that ensure maximum visibility of the events. TV, Radio spots and interviews of highly-profiled researchers are foreseen, at national level, spreading the messages throughout the country while, at local level, apart from traditional communication ways of promotions, other innovative ones, such as the ìtaxi of researcherî will be used to provoke the curiosity of local communities.\nThe awareness campaign will target the general public however special focus will be given on University students by explaining the benefits of the researcherís profession thus playing a small but not insignificant role to the realization of the Horizon 2020 which calls out for more researchers within Europe.\nThe events will be organized, mainly, in central places of the cities and will give the possibility of interaction between the public and the researchers throughout various activities which will be related to the problems of the local community and the solutions that researchers are able to provide, thus intriguing the publicís interest. \nIit is estimated, conservatively, that ReN2014-5 messages will reach at least one million people nation-wide while more than 20.000 people will actually participate in the events each year. \nThe impact of the events will be measured using quantitative data from questionnaires, number of participants and qualitative data such as references in media during the post-event days.",
