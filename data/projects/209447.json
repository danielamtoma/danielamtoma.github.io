    "objective": "Communication strategy and tools for optimizing the impact of Ebola vaccination deployment.\n\nThe EBODAC consortium consists of 4 partners: Janssen (EFPIA), London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), World Vision of Ireland and Grameen Foundation . These partners have experience and expertise in:\nï\t(Ebola) vaccine development and vaccine acceptance; m-health deployments for disease management in resource limited settings (Janssen)\nï\tVaccine acceptance; risk management in health programs (LSHTM)\nï\tMobile health deployments for emergency assistance; communication and training delivery in emergency settings (World Vision)\nï\tMobile health software development and deployment in resource limited settings (Grameen)\n\nAs such, the EBODAC consortium is well placed to tackle the challenges associated with Ebola vaccine deployment, including:\nï\tStigma related to Ebola infections\nï\tLack of understanding and distrust versus vaccines in general in the local endemic communities\nï\tTwo step prime/booster regimen for Ebola vaccine: risk for a ëno showí for the booster shot, risk for presenting for the booster shot too early or too late; risk for a different person presenting for the booster shot vs. the prime shot\nï\tPeople may be difficult to reach for the vaccine recall; People may live at a large distance from the health center where the vaccine is delivered\nï\tRisk for data on vaccine coverage to be fragmented, not existing or incorrect\n\nThe EBODAC consortium is committed to deliver:\nï\tA communication strategy that will optimize vaccine acceptance, supported by local anthropology research data\nï\tA platform, based on mobile phone technology, for Ebola vaccine recalls, information/education on Ebola and vaccines in general; and tracking of vaccination coverage \nï\tAn identification tool to allow to match the identity of individuals in the prime and boost vaccine regimens\nï\tA training program in the local setting, and a helpdesk function, to support the m-health platform, and the communication strategy deployment\n\nThe project currently is designed to take 3 years, but will have to synchronize with the timelines and outcome of the IMI2 Ebola\\ Call, Topic 1.",
