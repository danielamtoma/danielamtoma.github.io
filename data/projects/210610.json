    "objective": "The objective of the project is is to develop scale models for the Synthetic Jet Actuator (SJA), that shall be used to enable the design of next generation SJAís, compared to state of the art. \nThe development of this scale model is intented for improvement of performance predictions, and modelling accuracy of SJA actuators, for future applications. A demonstration rationale is therefore targeted, in order to enable accurate theoretical performance estimations, for given actuator configurations, calculated from geometrical input parameters, and transducer elements parameters.   \nIn order to achieve such an objective, the project activities will focus first on analyses and tests of existing SJAís designs, provided by the topic manager, in order to derive accurate numerical models, and achieve lessons learings, before designing, manufacturing, and testing of a third scale model.",
