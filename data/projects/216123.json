    "objective": "Within the 6th call of Clean Sky 2, the Voice Crew Interaction (VOICI) project aims to develop the technology that implements an intelligent voice crew interaction system as a 'natural crew assistant' in a cockpit environment up to TRL 3. The main goal of the project is to provide a proof-of-concept demonstrator of a natural crew assistant, which is capable of listening to all communications occurring in the cockpit, either between crew members or between crew and ATC, recognizing and interpreting speech content, interacting with the crew and fulfilling crew requests, such as to simplify crew tasks and reduce workload. The topic leader has predefined: sound recording, voice recognition and artificial intelligence, as the three main technology components constituting the system, which should fulfil specific predefined requirements. Robustness against noisy environment, high recognition rate and requests interpretation are among the predefined requirements. An audio evaluation environment will be developed, which will allow the evaluation of the sound recording/voice recognition systems and natural crew assistant according to evaluation scenarios provided by the topic manager.",
