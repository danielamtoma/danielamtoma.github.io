    "endDate": "31/08/2020",
    "objective": "One of the greatest challenges of the 21st century is to mitigate global climate changes caused by increasing emissions of greenhouse gases. Since soils constitute a larger carbon (C) pool than the vegetation and atmosphere together an important strategy could be to sequester more C in soils. Plant-soil interactions play an important role for ecosystem services such as C sequestration and N retention in soil and such interactions receive increasing attention among scientists and policymakers. Novel techniques such as next generation sequencing methods in combination with analysis of C stock patterns under different tree species present an opportunity to highlight complex processes and mechanisms which underlie C and N fluxes in soil. The proposed research is designed to (1) explore litter-mediated effects of common European tree species on C and N turnover in soil, (2) characterize effects of tree species on community structure and composition of soil biota, (3) evaluate the impact of common European tree species on metabolic diversity and structure and composition of functional genes related to C and N turnover: and finally, (4) to synthesize the role of soil biota for C and N turnover in soils. The research will be carried out within a unique common garden experiment with monoculture stands of six common European tree species; the broadleaves beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.), lime (Tilia cordata L.), sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.) and the conifer Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). The proposed Marie-Curie fellowship is promising to highlight impacts of common European trees on complex interactions among soil microbiota and soil fauna and highlights their role for C and N stocks and fluxes. Results obtained from this research will contribute to bridge gaps in ecological theory in term of ecosystem functions and services.",
