    "objective": "HySiLabs is proposing a liquid fuel technology capable of producing hydrogen on-site and on-demand.  The liquid fuel is stable, non-toxic, and non-explosive, and is therefore easy to transport and to store. Hydrogen is produced via a chemical reaction, in a reactor called a hydrogen generation unit, and consumed directly, thus removing the need to store the gas. The technology has already been implemented into several applications, including power for telecom towers and forklifts for material handling, and HySiLabs is now looking to extend the technology to hydrogen refueling stations for fuel cell electric vehicles. The technology is well-fitted for the hydrogen refueling station application because it circumvents any safety issues dealing with the transportation and on-site storage of high-pressure flammables. In addition, the hydrogen production occurs rapidly and spontaneously, with no energy input required, reducing the operating expenses linked to hydrogen production.",
