    "objective": "Aequor's ABD (Aequor Biofilm Dispersant) represents a significant leap forward in the arms race between modern medicine and drug-resistant bacteria. The biofilm is the first line of defence for these drug-resistant microorganisms, a polymer-like structure of proteins and secretions that protects the colony from virtually everything but burning or scraping it away.\n\nABD does away with this problem in dramatic fashion. A natural biocidal agent derived from marine microorganisms, ABD is devastating for bacterial contamination, but gentle enough to be used as a supplement for antibiotic treatments. It is 99.99% effective at removing existing biofilms, prevents 99.99% of new biofilms from forming, and inhibits the growth of new bacterial colonies by over 92%. Lonza Group AG has verified this stellar performance in-vitro.\n\nAequor intends to use the funds from the SME instrument to study the EU and global market for biocides further, and to dig deeper into markets for antibiotic supplements. Further it will carry out growth projections and examine the process for clinical trials in-depth.",
