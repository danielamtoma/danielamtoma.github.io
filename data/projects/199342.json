    "objective": "The project aims at improving the quality and quantity of fish products by implementing ultrasound into the current processing lines of fresh fish. This technology is well-known to have significant effect on the rate of preservation, reducing the microbiological activity (99.9%) at low temperatures (0-3C), decreasing the processing times and costs, eliminating post-treatment of water waste and consuming less energy. Ultrasound is a green and non-toxic technology that will contribute to increase the commercial shelf life of fish products and will help fish processing companies in Europe to increase their production capacity.",
