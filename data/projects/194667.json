    "objective": "Heliox, a company specialized in switch mode power technology, is developing a Conductive Fast Charge System for buses which will offer a cost-effective breakthrough technology for zero emission public transport AND competitive strength to the European Bus manufacturing industry. Heliox' Conductive Fast Charge System is designed for opportunity charging at e.g. end of bus line, extending the range of an (H)EV. A minimal onboard energy storage, enough to reach the next charging station, becomes practically sufficient to optimally operate a vehicle with low TCO and high availability. Potential userds are: Potnetial users are public transport operators and European bus manufacturers.\n\nThe objective of this feasibility study is to further verify the technological /practical as well as economical viability of the product. The 6 months of Phase 1 will be used to develop a detailed business plan, strengthen the relationship with potential customers and partners and define the technology. Heliox intend to submit a Phase 2 appliciation after finishing Phase 1.",
