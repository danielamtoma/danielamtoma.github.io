    "objective": "EPIGEN test is a ready-to-use tool capable to lead the oncologist to the best Non Smal Cell Lung Cancer treatment, the most common subtype of lung cancer (80% of cases). The standar treatments to combat NSCLC are both chemo- and radiotherapy, but many patients (up to 65%) presents resistance, and currently there is not any tool available for the clinician to predict it. The EPIGEN test will allow the clinician a patient stratification in terms of the patient susceptibility to radio- and chemotherapy, and therefore lead for a personalyzed prescription. The EPIGEN test tecnology is based on the determination of the methylation percentage of the epigenetic biomarker IGFBP-3 in the patient tumor samples. The methylation percentage of IGFBP-3 is determined by using qMS-PCR (quantitative methylation specific polymerase chain) tecnique, a well known and extended biochemistry tecnique. The methylation percentage provided by using the EPIGEN test protocol and reagents in the qMS-PCR tecnique will lead the clinician for the optimal NSCLC treatment, avoiding the possible patient resistance to chemo and radiotharapy, and therefore unnecesary side effects and costly therapies.",
