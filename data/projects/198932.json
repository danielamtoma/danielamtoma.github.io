    "objective": "Poor Manís Differential GNSS for Drones (PUMPED) is a low-cost real-time precise navigation solution based on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) for Unmanned Vehicles, in particular Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). The UAV business has experienced a boost in the recent years and is already playing a key role in our society and life. PUMPED aims at increasing dronesí positioning accuracy in order to empower them for carrying out more demanding and critical missions and applications. The idea behind PUMPED consists of applying Differential GNSS (DGNSS) techniques using low profile GNSS chipsets, which are usually the ones mounted in UAVsí platforms. This approach allows for a versatile, cheap and ease of installation and deployment solution for users, i.e. UAVs manufacturers and/or operators. \n\nThe accuracy offered by PUMPED will lie between 10cm and 50cm, therefore it will fill the existing gap in positioning products between low-cost-low-accuracy (meter error) and high-cost-high-accuracy (centimetric error).\n\nAs a side product, the technology developed during PUMPED will be easily transferred to other big markets such as smartphones, allowing apps to benefit from better accuracies.",
