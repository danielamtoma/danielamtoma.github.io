    "objective": "The full structuration of light in the transverse plane, including intensity, phase and polarization, holds the promise of unprecedented capabilities for applications in classical optics as well as in quantum optics and information sciences. Harnessing special topologies can lead to enhanced focusing, data multiplexing or advanced sensing and metrology. In this context, the present project aims at interfacing atomic ensembles with structured light exhibiting high topological charges, beyond the two-dimensional case. Two directions will be investigated: the realization of highly multimode quantum memories at the single-photon level with applications to quantum networks, and the demonstration of highly-sensitive magnetometer based on photonic gears.",
