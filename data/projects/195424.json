    "objective": "As can be seen in the history of science, new techniques and methods open new research fields. In this project, the authors propose to use a new methodology approach to study thin layers of condensed matter and surfaces. We aim to perform Attosecond Transient Absorption Spectroscopy combined with femtosecond Transient Grating to study ultrafast time evolution of a model sample ñ solid krypton.\n\nWe identify our major objectives as work packages:\nWP1: Attosecond XUV Transient Absorption Spectroscopy of gaseous krypton.\nWP2: Attosecond XUV Transient Absorption Spectroscopy in the condensed phase, the example of solid krypton.\nWP3: Condensed phase Transient Grating spectroscopy in the XUV spectral range with attosecond resolution.\n\nAll experiments will be performed by O. Hort PhD within the Ultrafast Laser Group led by Prof. A. Baltuöka (Photonics Institute, the Vienna University of Technology, Austria).",
