    "objective": "Direct high temporal resolution observations of the ice column from Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf (FRIS) will be used to investigate ocean variability in an ice shelf cavity. New data processing techniques will be developed to separate melt rates and strain rates at tidal time scales. The resulting fully-processed melt-rate time series will be used to understand the extent of ocean spatial and temporal variability under FRIS. An eddy-resolving model of the FRIS cavity will be applied, validated using these data, and mechanisms responsible for the observed variability will be identified. The output of the eddy-resolving model will be used to optimise the representation of important small scale processes in an existing coarser version of the model. This will ultimately lead to an improved capability to simulate the global effect of the interactions between ice shelves and the ocean.",
