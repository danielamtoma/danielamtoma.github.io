    "objective": "Metabolomics is a relatively new technology that provides information about levels of human metabolites, the low molecule products at the end (downstream) of the metabolic pathways of human physiology. In theory, metabolite profiles may more closely reflect the clinical phenotype and thus potentially improve risk prediction. Another advantage is that that they can be performed on non-invasive biofluids like urine. Several metabolomics studies have suggested that the metabolite profile of an individual can be used as a predictor of type 2 diabetes. However, evidence from large-scale population-based studies with comprehensive phenotypes of diabetes and thyroid disease is limited. The aim of the project is to identify urine metabolite profiles associated with risk of diabetes and thyroid disease and to investigate pathogenetic pathways by identifying genetic determinants of these metabolites. The project takes advantage of the long tradition of population-based and registry-based epidemiological research in Denmark. The experienced researcher will complete a training program supervised by two recognised Danish research institutions with complementary expertise in the fields of epidemiology and genetics, respectively. Hereby the experienced researcher will achieve competences in the field of statistical modelling of epidemiological data with repeated measures and use of the unique Danish registries for research. Furthermore, during the secondment at the partner institution the experienced researcher will receive training in genetic epidemiology. In return, knowledge of metabolomics will be translated to the beneficiary and partner organizations. It is expected that the results will provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of diabetes and thyroid disease and identify novel biomarkers to improve risk prediction in individuals.",
