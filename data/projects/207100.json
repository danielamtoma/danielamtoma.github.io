    "objective": "'Vestd is an innovative, disruptive, platform-based enabler of the sharing economy.  We are the first company to allow entrepreneur's to found their business with a share structure that enables them to use a portion of their equity to procure services or reward customers in a secure, regulated marketplace.  Our platform provides both the equity distribution tool that delivers this and a community of experienced Founders and Contributors to support and invest in each other.  Having achieved FCA regulatory approval in the UK (and via the passport system in the EU) in November 2015, we have moved to a proof of concept pilot in the UK during 1H 2016, which has demonstrated that the 'equity economy' works, and we are now looking to expand our operations into the EU.  This proposal is for funding to support a research project to better understand the issues, barriers and challenges associated with implementing our platform in key european markets during the course of 2017.'",
