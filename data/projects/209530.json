    "objective": "Integrating a thermoelectric (TE) module into a PV module can convert the accumulated heat of the PV into electricity, thus increasing electricity yield of the unit. A traditional spectrum integration PV-TE unit, by coupling the equal sized TE and PV modules, can harvest 30% more electricity than the PV unit alone. However, the pair-arrangement between the PV and TE modules appears to be economically unfeasible, owing to the significantly higher cost and lower power output of the TE module. By introducing a low cost and high efficiency micro-channel heat pipe (MCHP) and placing the PV onto the evaporator of the MCHP and TE underneath its condenser, the systemís cost will be significantly reduced while its power output remains almost same as to the pair-arranged PV-TE system. The proposed MSCA programme aims to characterise and optimise the novel PV-TE-MCHP, by integrating the excellence of the host applicant in PV and MCHP and the expertise of the researcher applicant in TE, solar energy and heat transfer technology, and by sharing the knowledge of both the host and researcher applicants in PV/T and computer simulation. The tasks involved include (a) conceptual design; (b) computer modelling/optimisation; (c) prototype construction & testing; and (d) economic and environmental performance analyses. As a result, the programme will deliver a novel PV-TE-MCHP prototype that, compared to the existing PV-TE systems, has a significantly lower cost while the electrical output remains the same. From the MSCA point of view, the project will attract an experienced researcher with particular knowledge in PV/T, TE and computer simulation into Europe. This will (a) achieve transfer of knowledge from outside into Europe, thus helping growing EUís knowledge-based economy and society; (b) develop a long term contact network among the researcher, host organisation, partner organisation and other associated institutions; and (c) enable advanced training to the researcher.",
