    "objective": "Helicobacter pylori is classified by the World Health Organisation as a carcinogen leading to gastritis and gastric cancer, the second most lethal cancer. The biggest challenge is to identify the infection at an early stage and give a more complete intervention as more than 85% of infections are asymptomatic. This makes screening/ testing an important primary action in combating H. pyrlori and its life threatening effects. Current non-invasive diagnosis methods are based on radiolabelling and are costly, cumbersome to the technician, inappropriate for wide spread clinical use and time consuming in delivering test results.\n\nAM-SENSE is a completely new and low-cost hand held electrochemical breathalyser device to efficiently and accurately measure the presence of ammonia in a person's breath to screen for H. pyroli giving ëinstant resultsí. Costs per test will decrease from an average of Ä60 to Ä9.50. The key markets for our product are Europe, Asia and the USA. We project, through manufacturing, retailing and licensing of AM-SENSE a turnover of Ä59 million in 5 years creating 35 new jobs. A sales forecast of 125,000 units has been set for the 5 year post commercialisation period. This will result in reduced gastric cancer incidence, cheaper and faster treatment for H. pyroli infection and lower all round societal cost.\n\nIn Phase 1 we intend to test AM-SENSE against gold standards and conduct a more intensified market study, tapping into the knowledge of breathalyser companies through partnerships.\n\nIn Phase 2 we intend to integrate the electrodes and electronics with the breath capture device into a single market ready prototype and validate with potential clients.",
