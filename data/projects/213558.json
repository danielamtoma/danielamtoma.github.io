    "objective": "The anti-decubitus system JUMPAIR will benefit a large number of patients who are suffering of decubitus ulcers (DeU) or they are running the risk to suffer it by remotely monitor ulcers biomarkers to improve early diagnoses through DeU prevention, and then through an advanced DeU treatment providing alerts at critical situations by the adoption of smart relevant ICT solutions for the health, well-being and well-ageing of patients. Additionally, JUMPAIR will also offer a rehabilitation programme for patients who suffered of DeU during the bedding in their house or in a hospital. The final product will contribute to prevent DeU and to improve healthcare expenditure containment avoiding unnecessary hospitalizations and therapeutic treatments. We believe that there is an unmet need in that field to deliver new and more efficient care to European citizens, and the final systems allows a preventive and therapeutic care of DeU having a great impact for physicians and patients who deal with this critical DeU disease.",
