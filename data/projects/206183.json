    "objective": "INJECTís objective is to transfer new digital technologies to news organisations to improve the creativity and the productivity of journalists, in order to increase the competitiveness of European news and media organisations. To achieve this objective, INJECT will extend and aggregate new digital services and tools already developed by consortium members to support journalist creativity and efficiency, and integrate the services and tools with current CMSs and journalist work tools in order to facilitate their uptake and use in newsrooms. The services will undertake new forms of automated creative search on behalf of journalists, using public sources (e.g. social media) and private digital resources (e.g. digital libraries of political cartoons) to generate sources of inspiration for journalists who are seeking new angles on stories. The tools will provide new interactive support for journalists to think creatively about new stories and reuse news content in new ways to increase productivity.  To transfer the new services and tools to Europeís news and media organisations, INJECT will establish a new INJECT spin-off business, build up and expand multiple vibrant ecosystems of providers and users of new digital technologies, and exploit its position at the heart of Europeís journalism industry to raise market awareness and take-up on the services and tools. With respect to Call ICT21, INJECT will increase the competitiveness of one of Europeís most important creative industries ñ journalism - by stimulating ICT innovation in SMEs, by effectively building up and expanding vibrant EU technological ecosystems that will meet the emerging needs of Europeís new and existing news and media organisations.",
