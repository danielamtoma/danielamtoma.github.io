    "objective": "The main objective of DEMICROCAROB project is the development and commercialisation of micronized dehydrated carob flour by means of an innovative and sustainable process based on a dehydration process using IR electromagnetic radiation and a specific milling process. DEMICROCAROB product has better properties than current products in the market, low humidity, steady microbiologic profile and without chemical additives. DEMICROCAROB preserves the original nutritional properties and active principles of raw carob and increases the lifetime of the product. As a summary, the purpose of DEMICROCAROB project is to develop and commercialise a new natural ingredient with functional properties (antioxidant, energetic, anticarcinogenic, antidiabetic, gluten free, etc.) from carob pulp. DEMICROCAROB project will commercialise raw carob flour (superfood) as an ingredient in functional food, sport food, diabetic food, coeliac food, vegan food and food supplements markets.",
