    "objective": "Complementing the ACI/IATA efforts, FLYSEC project aims to develop and demonstrate an innovative integrated and end-to-end airport security process for passengers, enabling a guided and streamlined procedure from the landside to airside and into the boarding gates, and offering for the first time an operationally validated innovative concept for end-to-end aviation security. \n\nOn the technical side, FLYSEC achieves its ambitious goals by integrating new technologies on video surveillance, intelligent remote image processing and biometrics combined with big data analysis, open-source intelligence and crowdsourcing. Repurposing existing technologies is also in the FLYSEC objectives, such as mobile application technologies for improved passenger experience and positive boarding applications (i.e. services to facilitate boarding and landside/airside wayfinding) as well as RFID for carry-on luggage tracking and quick unattended luggage handling. Besides more efficient background checks and passenger profiling, FLYSEC aims to implement a seamless risk-based security process within FLYSEC combining the aforementioned technologies with behavioural analysis and innovative cognitive algorithms. A key aspect in the design of FLYSEC risk-based security is applying  ethical-by-design patterns,  maximizing the efficiency of security controls through passenger differentiation ranging from ìunknownî to ìtrustedî, while remaining ethical and fair in the process. Policy, regulatory and standardisation aspects will also be examined in the context of FLYSEC innovative security concept.",
