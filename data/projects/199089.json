We lead the Italian market, with over 35% market share, and are a relevant European and worldwide player, exporting over 55% of our production.\nREFEREE is a technology upon which we will build a brand new line of fluids metering & dispensing equipment conforming to European Directive 2014/32/EU, the Measuring Instruments Directive (MID), that will include a Proprietary Air Separation Subsystem. We will focus on Automotive (specifically electric and pneumatic pumps for non-fuel liquids), Industrial (mechanical industry of production of cylinders, cranes, gear reducers, vehicles and motors) and, alternatively, the Marine sector.\nWe submitted our project to the Phase 1 SME Instrument last year and successfully obtained funding to perform a Feasibility Study in order to test our prototype and analysis the market constraints. Results obtained from our on-going development and feasibility analysis (see Section 4) makes us confident in achieving our goal of further increasing our sales by up to 60% in the EU and consolidating our international presence.",
