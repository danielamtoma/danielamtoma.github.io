    "objective": "Specific recruitment of different proteins to distinct intracellular membranes is fundamental in the biology of eukaryotic cells, but the molecular basis for specificity is incompletely understood. This proposal investigates the hypothesis that coincidence detection of proteins and lipids constitutes a major mechanism for specific recruitment of proteins to intracellular membranes in order to control cellular membrane dynamics.  CODE will establish and validate mathematical models for coincidence detection, identify and functionally characterise novel coincidence detectors, and engineer artificial coincidence detectors as novel tools in cell biology and biotechnology.",
