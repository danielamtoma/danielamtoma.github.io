    "objective": "Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in the world, with nearly 1.4 million new cases diagnosed in 2012. The frequency of complications after surgery is relatively high, but rapid and safe monitoring methods are missing.\n\nMD Biomedical AB has addressed this need and developed a radically new and innovative piece of medical equipment that is gently attached on the surface of the bowel for sampling of biomakers. This makes it possible to detect complications within minutes, at an early stage of illness, and long before patient systemic indications. \n\nThe possibility of rapid counteractions improves the treatment of the patient and save health care costs.\n\nThe feasibility study comprises one work package divided in 6 tasks and shall in measurable terms assess the functional, medical, economic, and environmental effects and the deliverable is a feasibility report including a business plan.",
