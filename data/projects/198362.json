    "objective": "MODER vision is cost-effective, energy-efficient and user-oriented refurbishment of buildings as part of the global energy system. The main objective of MODER is to increase business of engineering companies, energy managers and consultants in supporting municipalities and building owners in European and global markets for the refurbishment of buildings at district level.\nThe project will develop, demonstrate and mobilize design tools, processes and business models for efficient refurbishment on building and district level. Design tools will enable evaluation of different retrofitting alternatives at different stages of projects, consideration of district level impacts and simultaneous consideration of cost and energy efficiency. Process development aims at sustainable retrofit design especially by developing models for procurement and models for design management.  Business models focus on  the generation and delivery of distributed energy to support new retrofit solutions which enable the use of local renewable energy sources.\nMODER consortium consists of 10 partners including 2 large engineering companies, 2 research and technology organisations and 6 SMEs of which one is a public energy manager. All partners are aiming at developing their engineering and / or consultation business towards refurbishment of buildings at district level. 4 partners aim at reinforcing their engineering or consultation business in areas outside Europe.",
