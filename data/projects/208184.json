    "objective": "PER (Professional Engineering Restoration) is an Italian SME that performs recovery and renovation services after catastrophic events. In particular, much care must be placed after fires in order to eliminate dangerous Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH). With, PAHremov, targets the upgrade and industrialization of an innovative solution, composed by the integration off PER's x1 cleaning solution and a lipopectic biosurfactant, being able to reach 100% complete removal and ulterior total biodegradation of PAH in a secure and sustainable way, which will takes place much faster than using the current alternatives based on organic solutions and biosurfactants notably improving their PAH removal capacity and taking just 6-8 hours for total removal and biodegradation. In addition, the final solution is biodegradable and smaller disposal volumes are produced. These facts mean an improved site recovery, less waste (almost 98 % less weight) and an improved impact for the environment. PAHremov will directly reduce the costs of these decontamination activities by about 70%,  allowing PER to intensify notably its international presence and increase its revenues. The payback for the estimated investment will be reached during the third year of commercialization of the PAHremov's based new service.",
