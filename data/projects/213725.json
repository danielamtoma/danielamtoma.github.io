    "objective": "People lose data and cannot get it back; people also want to ensure data is deleted permanently (erased). We have achieved proof of concept for an innovative solution to recover deleted items from smartphones and tablets. Cloud Recovery is the only customer data restoration solution from Europe; the others are from China, India and the US, but all of these solutions require a PC. Our project aim is to push the boundaries, and deliver a truly market disruptive SaaS (Software as a Service) data recovery solution that is solely cloud-based (where more data is stored), with data recovered and restored within 10 minutes, without the need for a PC or Mac.",
