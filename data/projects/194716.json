    "objective": "Magpie Polymers, a start-up founded in 2011, produces proprietary filtration technology with extreme selectivity and high performance in difficult to treat waste or process water. Selectively removing metals from complex effluents creates value for industries dealing with precious metals such as palladium, platinum, iridium, rhodium and gold. The main focus of commercial development of the SME is the precious metal refining industry, with growth potential in precious metal mining. \n\nWhereas initial sales of Magpie Polymers' technology are made for the treatment of waste-streams to recover the last traces of precious metals, in the innovation program VIPREP, the SME aims to accelerate growth by integrating vertically into refining processes.\n\nVertical integration for Magpie consists in adjusting and improving its unique technology so that it can be used upstream in the refining process of the customers. The drivers for this vertical integration are speeding-up the refining process and decreasing the loss of precious metals at each step. Magpie's resins are furthermore easy-to-handle and non-toxic, contrary to the reagents currently used in the industry. \n\nVertical integration of the unique filtration beads that selectively bind platinum group metals will translate to a 20x larger accessible market for the SME, stronger customer engagement and creation of higher added value for the user.",
