    "objective": "'The proponents aim to establish an international leading company in the field of innovative medical devices for laser eye surgery, keratoplasty in particular (cornea transplantation): the objective is to become pioneers in the field of ophthalmic surgery with a novel surgical technique of cornea laser welding for keratoplasty called SWeetLight (suturing with light). The specific aim is realise a medical device able to:\nï improve the quality and the overall precision of the keratoplasty,\nï standardize the surgical treatment by enhancing surgeon skills using robotic platform adopting collaborative control system to optimize the welding task of corneal wounds.\nï strongly reduce the risk of rejection and also of astigmatism, also respecting and preserving the donorís cornea, \nï reduce the duration of the post-hospitalization phase: faster and safer visual recovery (fast ìback to workî)\nï reduce the dependency of the intervention from the surgeon skills.\nFrom ìbusinessî point of view the objective is to reach the Break Even Point (BEP) at the end of year #2, and a value of revenues of Ä 4 million at the end of year #5.\n'",
