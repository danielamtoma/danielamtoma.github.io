    "objective": "Despite legislative and technological progress made over the past 20 years, incidents involving motorcyclists are still cause of concern for the European Union and Member States. The main cause of accidents remains high speed, especially in the presence of specific dangerous road points. The project's aim is to launch, on the European two-wheeled market, the first wearable device able to warn motorcyclists well in advance of the presence of dangerous spots and road sections in which the speed must be carefully controlled. The device, called WOOLF, has been specifically conceived for motorcyclists, developed by exploiting the potential of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and instant updated road databases. Once on the market, WOOLF will help to dramatically reduce the risk of road accidents for thousands of motorcyclists.",
