    "startDate": "01/01/2015",
    "endDate": "31/12/2018",
    "objective": "The main goal of this project is to train the next generation of experts on the Caspian region in order to establish, and make sustainable, a network of excellence. This will be achieved through an integrated PhD programme on the Caspian that boosts the researchers√≠ theoretical, empirical and administrative skills, a thing that will make them extremely competitive for employment in both academic and non-academic sectors but also confident and knowledgeable enough to start their own projects. The training will enhance the research skills of the ESRs while also giving them a first-hand experience with a partner operating in a different environment, thus learning how to apply their skills to different fields and sectors. We expect our network and training to become a leading voice on issues related to the Caspian region both in academia and other sectors.",
