    "objective": "Diagnosing cancer as early as possible is one of the most powerful strategies in modern medicine to improve\nhuman well-being. Antibodies (Abs) are excellent molecules that can be used to target specific tumors. As Abs\nrequire hours to days for accumulating on tumor surfaces, the use of Abs for nuclear imaging (such as PET\nimaging) is limited by the short half-lives of popular radioisotopes. Therefore, we plan to move the step of radiolabeling\nfrom the bench to the tumor itself. However, the entanglement of Abs with an artificial chemical probe is\none of the most promising but at the same time one of the most technically challenging developmental areas in\nbiotechnology. Our unique approach is based on the production of ìhybrid-Absî, which combine in only one ìclickî\nstep the power of synthetic chemistry with the best of biology (ìcustom-biologicsî). Our unique selling points are\nultra-fast, exceptional bioorthogonal and specific labeling reactions in living organism as well as a both-sided\nmodularity of the connection between Abs and chemical probe. By doing so, high contrast visualization of the\ncancer will become possible.",
