    "objective": "The aim of this project is to develop supramolecular polymer brushes through the self-assembly of cyclic peptide/polymer conjugates into functional materials for applications as therapeutic polymers. The research program is articulated around 1/the fabrication of supramolecular polymers of precisely controlled structures from peptide√±polymer conjugate synthesis to self-assembly and 2/applying these supramolecular polymers to build delivery vehicles for therapeutic applications.",
