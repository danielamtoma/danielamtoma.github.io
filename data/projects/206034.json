    "objective": "'TimeProSAMAT aims to introduce concepts to program the time domain of self-assembled systems and materials in CLOSED systems under non-equilibrium conditions by controlling the kinetics of assembly and disassembly pathways via (i) modulating the surrounding by feedback systems, (ii) dissipative structure formation and (iii) active structural feedback. After reaching a fundamental understanding on a SA level, we want to capitalize on these enabling SA concepts by providing entirely new and original approaches to dynamic soft materials with internally encoded self-regulation features (similar to a self-destruction mechanism), opening doors to active functionalities and adaptive properties beyond what classical responsive equilibrium SA can offer.\nRead more about such concepts in the 10th year anniversary issue of Soft Matter: 'Approaches to program the time domain of self-assemblies' Soft Matter, 2015,11, 7857-7866'",
