    "objective": "As DNA testing is most commonly centralised in labs, it lacks the turnaround time for time-sensitive applications, and also lacks mobility. The experience in biology required to prepare samples and carry out testing obfuscate the process and limit point-of-care applications. Biomeme seeks to break down these barriers with their versatile Dx System, a holistic solution to bring DNA testing out of the labs and into the physician√≠s office. Thus, Biomeme provides Molecular Diagnostics for the on-demand economy. By simplifying the process of DNA testing, without sacrificing the detail to be found in raw data, the Biomeme solution brings molecular diagnostic into point-of-care medical services, making it available for homecare and other point-of-need uses.",
