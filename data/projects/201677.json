    "objective": "We have developed a hybrid multi copter with 6 times more endurance than any electric multirotor for ISR and emergency response applications. Our solution is available in three versions of 20, 50 and 100 Kg. With flight time between 2 Ã± 6 hr. This disruptive innovation significantly reduces operative and maintenance costs regarding existing alternatives such as fixed-wing UAVS or helicopters and increases speed of response, cost-effectiveness and safety.",
