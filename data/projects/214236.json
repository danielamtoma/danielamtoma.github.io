    "objective": "Integro-SD Company (ISD) implements own patented technology of animal waste processing (incl. chicken manure) into high-demand quality organic fertilizers. ISD doesn√≠t use herbage, biological and chemical catalysts in IMBIO technology.\nIncreasing demand for organic fertilizers tells about the necessity of ramping up its production. IMBIO technology allows occupying empty market niche of high-quality organic fertilizers production in the segment of small and medium farm enterprises. The offered technology is highly-productive, waste-free, compact, easy to scale, non-hazardous for the environment and also has low construction budget. IMBIO allows reducing or totally refusing the usage of mineral fertilizers, increasing the yield of cultivated crops, getting added value by waste processing, organic products and new small-scale production, as well as creating closed production cycle for small farm enterprises, poultry plants and other representatives of the branch.",
