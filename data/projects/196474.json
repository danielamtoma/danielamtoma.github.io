    "objective": "Sustained Release Ocular Bevacizumab for the treatment of wet acute macular degeneration\n\nThis feasibility study is to verify the technical and economic viability of a sustained release bevacizumab product (SR Bevacizumab) to improve the safety, cost-effectiveness and patient acceptability for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD is the leading cause of blindness in those aged over 50 and causes blurring, distortion and loss of central vision and almost always affects quality of life.  Prototype SR Bevacizumab products will be manufactured using CriticalMix, an advanced manufacturing and processing technology developed by Critical Pharmaceuticals, which will encapsulate bevacizumab in biodegradable polymers suitable for sustained release of the drug in the eye.",
