    "startDate": "01/06/2017",
    "endDate": "30/11/2017",
    "objective": "In the past 5 years Single Quantum has brought superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) to the scientific market that works on developing quantum communication technology. We observed a strong market pull from physicists all over the world, resulting in a turnover growing from 200,000 Euro in 2013 to a turnover of 1.6 M Euro in 2016. \nSince single photon detectors are the most sensitive light detectors thinkable, they are also very interesting for applications where just a very low level of light need to be detected. The problem is that our SNSPDs/single photon detectors are largely unknown in markets other than the scientific quantum technology market. In addition we don`t know the exact requirements and a good price level, the certifications needed and the best distribution channels. The goal of the feasibility study is to give an answer to these questions and a more detailed insight in the potential markets, a definition of the system specifications required for a product to conquer the market, a technical description of the device for this markets.",
