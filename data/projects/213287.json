    "objective": "The Danish SME CSR Research aims to pursue a major opportunity through the maturation of a social based online platform ñ CHARITY 24-7 ñ that promotes simultaneously the online consumersí surveys and charity donations. CHARITY 24-7 approach is based on a shared value business model that joins (i) the need for consumerís data by consumer goods retailers/manufacturers/service companies from different sectors, (ii) the engagement of surveys participants and (iii) the need for donations by NGOs and charity organisations. \nOur plan with the current Phase 1 project is to validate the segments and geographic areas that will bring more value to CHARITY 24-7 at this stage ñ i.e. the ones with larger potential to trigger a chain-reaction, leading us faster to the critical mass goal. Other objectives include the business model validation and establishment of pricing strategy. Moreover, the end-userís requirements and preferences will be established and the platform extra features defined.\nThe implementation of the innovation project will place CSR Research ApS in a strong position to exploit a market potential over five years exceeding Ä15M aggregated revenues. The total donations are expected to reach Ä4.7M and the tendency is to increase as CHARITY 24-7 is deployed.",
