    "objective": "Flat optics is used in everyday, compact devices like mobile phones and other portable devices, where size and weight is important. DeLight will transform the holographic resonant nano-scale laser printing of flat optics using template dielectric meta-surfaces, developed by DTU in FET OPEN CHROMAVISION, into a commercially attractive and sustainable business and a University spin-off. The DeLight ultra-high resolution laser printing technology enables mass-customization of flat-optics, with a wide application field, such as opthalmic lenses, advanced optical filters, and optical sensor technology for the Internet of Things (IoT). DTU has filed three international patent applications on the technology and published the research results in high impact journals (Nature Nanotechnology, Science Advances, Nature Reviews Materials). At present, the technology is  at TRL4. The technology is demonstrated in the lab. The main project activity will be: 1) Develop a business case, 2) Identify the market segments and needs, 3) asses technology with end-users and 4) initiate a University spin-off.",
