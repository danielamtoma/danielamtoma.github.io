    "objective": "The objective of MAXITHERM is to contribute to the expansion of Electric mobility in Europe by extending Electric Vehicles (EV) autonomy. We propose a heating system for EV that reduces electricity demand of heating systems in by 30% while maitaining passenger comfort. MAXITHERM is a heating system based on a technical fabric composed by a blend of electrically conductive and non-electrically conductive fibres that is integrated within the structure of the vehicles. It provides direct and fast heat to passangers and is more cost efficient than current solutions.\nThe final development stages of Maxitherm will be carried out by three European SMEs, MaxiTex (DE) (coordinator and IPR owner), Metron (SI) a CHMÂ¸ller (DE). The sales of Maxitherm will boost the growth of the three companies involved and will provide them with a strategic position in the Electric Vehicle industry, a highly interesting growing market.",
