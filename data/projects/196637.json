    "objective": "Slag is a by-product of metal smelting, and ~3.5 million tpa are produced globally in refining Non Ferrous Metals (NFM) and making alloys. Slag contains impurities and forms a protective crust of non-metallic & metallic oxides, and contains significant ëfreeí & alloyed metal (from 10 to 70% by weight). While slag can be used as aggregate, there are increasing concerns over ëleachingí of heavy metals into water courses from using these materials in civil engineering. While some metal can be recovered by re-melting slag (at very high temp), this is extremely expensive with very high energy burden which often makes recovery un-economic, but necessary. Landfill of slag is increasingly not an option. Our idea is to use a relatively new technology called ëimplosioní to selectively break down and separate non-metallic components of slag from metallic particles. This will be combined with ultrasonic vibration sieving for accelerated recovery of metal from the finest fraction. This novel technology was originally developed to recycle waste glass by reducing it to fine ësandí, with uniform size and no ësharpsí compared to normal crushing techniques. This technology has not been applied commercially to other materials. Benefits to partners, endusers & society could be: \nï Rapid recovery of more metal from slag at relatively low cost\nï Strategic control of metal recovered rather than losing control throí export to ëlow costí economies \nï Enable smelters to recycle slag in-house, increasing their ëValue Addí while reducing ërecycle-milesí\nï 97% energy saving throí low cost mechanical separation rather than very high temp. melt recycling\nï Huge cut in carbon emissions from thermal energy saved and ërecycle-milesí saved\n\nThe ultimate goal is to launch a new process in the market, through an innovative application of a relatively new technology to selectively break down the non-metallic components of slag from the metallic particles.",
