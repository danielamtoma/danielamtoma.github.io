    "objective": "This proposal describes an unprecedented, enantioselective haloborylation reaction through the innovative application of chiral anion phase-transfer (CAPT) catalysis to electrophilic-induced boronate rearrangements. Beyond the development of an orthogonal approach towards the formal trifunctionalization of alkenes, the proposed methodology provides easy access to biologically and synthetically important products, and is anticipated to have great impact in the area of diversity oriented synthesis.",
