    "objective": "Hudson River Biotechnology (HRB) aims to disrupt the global market for purified lutein. Marigold is the crop used to produce 95% of global pure lutein and we will significantly increase lutein content of this crop through manipulation of gene expression, based on an existing proof of concept. The technical feasibility of modulating gene expression in marigold (stable lines that can be regenerated) has been demonstrated. In this phase 1 project, HRB will further research the feasibility of this business case, with a focus on complying with relevant international regulatory aspects. In addition, we have a collaboration with Wageningen University, among the world√≠s foremost agricultural research institutes, to work towards a major technical milestone: proof of concept that manipulating gene expression in marigold results in significantly increased lutein yields. Both the technical feasibility and interest from the market are independently confirmed in attached letters of recommendation. One recommendation is from one of the largest commercial players in this market, who will also serve as an advisor to this project. As such, even though HRB is currently in startup phase, the project is well de-risked.",
