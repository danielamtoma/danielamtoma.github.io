    "objective": "PLASTICAL is a well-known plastic manufacturing company which designs and produces a variety of plastic components within different sectors by means of Injection Molding technology. The purpose of this project is to address a common problem that farmers encounter relating to the effects of hailstorms on crops. Farmers are seeking cost-effective solutions to protect their crops and increase their profitability and productivity in a sustainable manner to meet with European consumer demands. Our project SYSTEMPOLE is focused on the development of composite poles (plastic matrix reinforced with pultruded material) to be used in anti-hail netting structures and replace the current alternatives (wood and concrete poles), offering a high-strength, durable, lightweight and maintenance-free solution to farmers. This eco-innovative solution will contribute to reduce the environmental impact and greenhouses gas emissions, along with the cost savings associated in terms of transportation and installation, thus, offer an alternative with optimum and better mechanical properties, helping our end users - farmers - to reduce the long-term investment.",
