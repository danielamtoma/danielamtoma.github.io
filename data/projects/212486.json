    "objective": "In January 2013, the five-year ERC funded project Citizen Sense was launched, investigating the role of low-cost and digital monitoring technologies in facilitating and organising new types of environmental engagement. This proposal brings together a comprehensive citizen-sensing toolkit for users to undertake air quality monitoring that realises the social and environmental potential of these technologies. With the benefit of five years of intensive and cutting-edge research, the Citizen Sense research project is exceptionally well positioned to develop an AirKit, thereby bridging the gap between our research and the early stages of innovation in order to realise the innovation potential of the project. Our research pioneers new strategies of citizen-led monitoring and data analysis that join up hardware and software developments along with social innovations in order to produce an AirKit toolkit that has the potential to revolutionise community monitoring infrastructures and practices. This PoC will help to establish the viability of the AirKit, to refine and address technical issues, and to consolidate the overall direction of the AirKit.",
