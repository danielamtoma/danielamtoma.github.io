    "startDate": "08/01/2018",
    "endDate": "07/01/2020",
    "objective": "The aim of the fellowship is to pioneer a synthetic method to form carbonñcarbon bonds from the coupling of two carbonñfluorine bonds. This method will result in new routes to fluorinated biaryls, organic molecules that are used in materials science or as the active ingredient in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. It will open up new pathways to using inexpensive and environmentally persistent fluorocarbons in synthesis. \nThe carbonñfluorine bond is the strongest single bond in organic chemistry and the main challenge of the project is to develop a new method that breaks two carbonñfluorine bonds in a single sequence. To the best of our knowledge, this approach is without precedent. The strategy offers a new route to fluorinated molecules with control over the number and position of fluorine atoms in the products. The proposed programme will provide world-class training in the areas of organometallic chemistry, homogenous catalysis and mechanistic analysis.",
