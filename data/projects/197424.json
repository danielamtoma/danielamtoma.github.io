    "objective": "The aim of SMITH innovation project is to design, develop, test under real life conditions and commercialise a novel product consisting of a Smart and Interoperable Thermal Network for micro-industrial based on biomass sources.\nUnique Value Proposition of the product is based on: 1) provide industrial parks with the opportunity to reduce energy costs by promoting the cascade use and the highest efficient management of the heating infrastructure; 2) combine the centralised management of the system with an application for real time decision-making of the final users (including real time consumption, invoicing, decisions about the different temperature level options, head demand planning, etc); 3) clearly foresee and plan before every product deployment the needed investment and infrastructure in order to assess the technical feasibility and profitability for both the consortium & customers; 4) design financial schemes based on energy service contracting that will avoid the industries to make investments for the new infrastructures; and, 5) reduce GHG emissions by using renewable energies in industrial networks, most of them located close to urban areas.\nThe SMITH strength vs natural gas source are: stable and lower price, better efficiency, more sustainable and flexible, high adaptation capacity to match consumption peaks vs users√≠ demand, better energy and temperatures management, high control of industrial process, and stop and go more resourceful.\nThe Feasibility Study will be focus on: a) assess the EU market needs in relation to the concrete product; b) select the countries with the best conditions to start the commercialisation of the product, and draft the business strategy for each country; c) profiling of customers in the target countries; d) obtain a direct feedback from consumers through a product concept testing; and, e) set all the critical variables needed for the go-to-market decision, the business plan and for the customer validation in Phase 2.",
