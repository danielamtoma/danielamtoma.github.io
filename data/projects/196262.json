    "objective": "ALBYN MEDICAL has developed, in cooperation with the Chemnitz University of Technology and the University Hospital of Cologne (Germany), a specific diagnostic system for the Overactive Bladder syndrome. This diagnostic device is implanted by cystoscopy and measures the bladder pressure autonomously, relating the bladder pressure with the urination, controlled or not, and it determines if the pressure rise appears only when a voluntary urination occurs or if also occurs other times as in the accidental urine loss.\nThanks to the new diagnostic device a reliable diagnostic evaluation is obtained and thus high treatment costs of the current Overactive Bladder over-diagnosis are avoided improving the sustainability of the European Health and Care systems.",
