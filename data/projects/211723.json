    "objective": "PICASCO aims to deliver the commercial proof of concept of a novel endto-\nend flow manufacturing and a novel corresponding compact flow mini\nplant. This is performed through the first continuous 4-step solvent-free\nflow manufacturing of a pharmaceutically relevant API compound at an\nindustrial scale. Currently applied batch manufacturing techniques leave\nmuch room for improved quality, efficiency, cost-effectiveness and\nenvironmental friendliness. Flow multi-step manufacturing can address all\nthese issues simultaneously, but to date has not been brought to an\nindustrially useful scale. PICASCO sets out to scale this final barrier.",
