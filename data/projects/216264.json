    "objective": "'As a common disease in western men, prostate cancer is a major driver for the billion-euro robotic surgery and laparoscopic devices markets. In the surgical management of prostate cancer patients, next to the tumor resection accuracy, the surgeonís ability to preserve the nerve-network and prevent erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence, is key. As these nerves are not visible by eye, image guided surgery approaches aimed at nerve-sparing demand the clinical availability of nerve-specific fluorescence tracers. Hereby it is expected that the ability to visualize peripheral nerves promotes nerve-sparing opportunities and opens up new commercial-avenues for companies involved in the surgical market. Previously my ILLUMINATING NERVES ERC-StG yielded a sensory-nerve targeted lead-compound that was made suitable for imaging somatic-nerves (MY NERVE ERC-PoC). This tracer, however, does not allow for imaging of the autonomic nerves. For autonomic nerves I have now shown, within the same ERC-StG, that an alternative tracer can be used as an imaging target. The aim of the AUTO NERVE ERC-PoC project is to convert the autonomic-nerve targeted lead-compound into a fluorescence tracer. Systematic fine-tuning of this lead will optimize the structure-activity relation and will improve the chance of future commercialization. Ultimately, the outcome of the three complementary ERC-grants should yield an advancement in clinical care.î'",
