    "objective": "Despite the investment of billions of euros, there has been an inexorable decline in the discovery of new antibiotics over the last decades. In this individual fellowship (IF) application we propose a strategy to develop bacterial histidine-kinase (HK) inhibitors targeted at the catalytic and ATP-biding domain (CA) as novel broad-spectrum antibacterial (nano)medicines. Furthermore, putative mechanism of resistance to HK inhibitors and known antibiotics will be studied and novel antibacterial drug targets will be identified by using transposon insertion mutant libraries (Tn-libraries) to identify mutations involved in intrinsic resistance to antibiotics and/or leading to increased sensitivity to existing antibiotics in multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains.",
