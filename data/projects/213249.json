    "startDate": "01/12/2017",
    "endDate": "28/02/2018",
    "objective": "The European Union targets to reduce the application of chemical pesticides, however due to the climate change and increased transportation, the problems related to pest invasions are increasing. We have developed a natural insecticide that can be applied during long-term grain storage based on formulated diatomaceous earth. Our product can kill all insects during storage with a long-lasting effect that is completely harmless to humans and other mammals. Our objective is to commercialise our diatomaceous earth as insecticide material during storage, to develop the commercialisation strategy (including pricing) and distribution channels in Europe as well as to scale-up and standardise our production. In this Phase 1 project we aim to carry out a feasibility study to confirm our preliminary business assumptions. The success of this project will promote the growth of our company.",
