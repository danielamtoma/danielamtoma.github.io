    "startDate": "01/09/2017",

    "objective": "This proposal describes the exploration of properties of the top quark for the study of Standard Model physics and tests of physics beyond the Standard model. Research will be conducted starting from the data of 13 TeV run of the Large Hadron Collider with particular focus on the determination of the top quark mass and other observables that might be sensitive to subtle new physics, which hides in standard searches for new physics carried out at the Large Hadron Collider experiments, in particular searches that suffer from large systematic uncertainties in the sensitive regions of phase space.",
