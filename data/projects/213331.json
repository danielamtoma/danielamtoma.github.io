    "objective": "Spaceit aims to make space missions more affordable by providing unique software as a service solution for satellite mission control. In specific, the solution is targeted for small satellite (<500 kg of weight) operators. Currently the majority of mission operators use custom made software, which is built separately for each mission. Current solutions are expensive, often unreliable and inefficient. Spaceit has already a light working prototype of the solution and current Phase 1 feasibility project will build sales pipeline, perform series of technical tests of the solution and improve the IPR protection.",
