    "objective": "Glycans, also referred to as carbohydrates, occur as simple or complex structures in free form or in many different kinds of glycoconjugates, which include glycoproteins, glycolipids and proteoglycans. Glycans carry information in biological systems that make them an important source of biomarkers for wide range of diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, hereditary disorders, immune deficiencies, cardiovascular diseases and many types of cancers. While recognition of glycans by other molecules with high affinity and exquisite specificity is at the heart of the early and accurate detection of such diseases, selective glycan recognition remains a daunting task due to their inherent diversity and complexity. The aim of this innovative Fellowship is to use concepts and tools from lipid membrane biophysics and molecular imprinting to provide synthetic recognition platforms with high sensitivity and specificity for glycans. For the first time, we will exploit (i) lateral mobility of polymerizable lipids functionalized with carbohydrate receptors in a fluid bilayer and, (ii) multivalent interactions between the target glycan and multiple carbohydrate receptors to produce liposome surfaces with high affinity binding sites that can sharply discriminate between different glycans, including tumour-associated glycans that contain sialylation, fucosylation and biantennary structures. Owing to great clinical importance of cancer-associated glycans for early detection and targeted therapies, the work will have significant economic and societal impacts, assisting the meeting of EU Directive requirements whilst providing an exceptional training opportunity for the ER.",
