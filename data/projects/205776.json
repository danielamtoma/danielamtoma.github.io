    "objective": "A new disposable sampling device that allows quantitative measurements from Dried Blood Spots (DBS) has been developed with support of the ERC AdG xMEMS.\nThe technology consists of a small microfluidic chip made of laminated structured plastic foils and paper with the specific function to meter and store an exact blood volume as a DBS. The chip can be used directly by a patient to leave a capillary blood sample straight from a finger prick. This\nsimplifies blood sampling, offers comfort for the patient and reduces costs for health care providers.\nIn this project we shall perform activities to:\nHave a first complete product (proposed within TDM) that works for users and is backed up by clinical test(s).\nA company is formed, the business plan is worked out in detail and it is ready for a next financing round.\nIPR strategy has been chosen and patent(s) on blood as well as plasma are secured accordingly.\nWe have worked out and tested a scalable and cost-efficient manufacturing and packaging\nstrategy.\nWe have chosen, prepared and acquired our first paying customer. We are ready to sell and have a plan for how to grow sales for defined product(s).",
