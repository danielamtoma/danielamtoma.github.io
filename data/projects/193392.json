    "startDate": "01/06/2015",
    "endDate": "30/11/2018",
    "objective": "Maritime disasters in recent years are a stark reminder of the imperative need for timely and effective evacuation of large passenger ships during emergency. The Lynceus2Market project addresses this challenge through delivering a revolutionary operational system for safe evacuation based on innovative people localisation technologies.\nThe system consists of: 1) Localisable life jackets that can provide passenger location in real-time during emergency 2) Smart smoke detectors that also act as base stations of an on-board localisation system 3) Innovative localisable bracelets able to send activity data to the emergency management team 4) Low cost fire and flooding escalation monitoring sensor notes 5) novel mustering handheld devices for automatic identification and counting of passengers during evacuation 6) Smart localisable cabin key cards 7) Intelligent decision support software able to fuse all localisation, activity and disaster escalation data to provide an integrated real-time visualisation, passenger counting and evacuation decision support 8) Innovative shore or ship-launched Unmanned Aerial Vehicle for localising people in the sea in short time and assisting search and rescue operations when accident occurs in extreme weather, during the night or in a remote location 9) Low-cost rescue-boat mounted radars for people localisation in the vicinity of the boat.\nThe proposed project is based on the promising results developed in the FP7 LYNCEUS project where the innovative technologies were tested in lab and in small scale pilots. Lynceus2Market brings together European global players in the field, such as cruise ship owners, operators, ship builders, maritime equipment manufacturers, a classification society, industry associations and important technology organisations with the aim to implement the first market replication of these technologies and products. The Lynceus2Market will create significant impact by saving passenger lives during maritime accidents.",
