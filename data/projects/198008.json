    "objective": "The developing hybrid electric vehicles and pure electric vehicles industry has led to the adoption of lithium ion batteries as the source of power. The durability and high energy density of Li-ion batteries makes them more favourable than other alternatives.  Li-ion batteries are inherently weak concerning to fire management systems. Short circuiting, overcharging, high temperatures and overheating cause thermal runaway and the release of a flammable electrolyte which makes fire extinguishing very difficult and this has stalled the progress of the HEV and EV industry. Current fire suppressing systems have failed to effectively deal with li-ion fires and Dafo Brand has come up with an innovative HEV/EVLi-ionFire project aimed at fire management and suppression for heavy commercial HEV and EV such as buses and trucks. Our proposed innovation would be 12% cheaper than current available technologies which use different li-ion fire suppression techniques. \n\nPhase 1 will focus on market study, partners search, optimisation of the technology used in internal combustion engines to suit HEV and EV standards as well as formulation of an IP management strategy in preparation for full project implementation in Phase 2. Technology validation and testing will be done in Phase 2.",
