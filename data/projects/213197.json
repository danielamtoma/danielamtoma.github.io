    "objective": "The objective is to validate concepts on avionics and use of instrument flight procedures tailored to General Aviation that enable integration and inclusion of GA within high density airspace or environments in which GA is constrained due to proximity of adjacent airports or airways for scheduled airlines or the military. The project builds on the concept demonstrated to the EVA project considering the suitability of ground monitoring from aerodromes with basic ATS or ground services and testing the viability for the use of PBN procedures more tailoured to the capabilities of GA and the limitations of operations in dense airspace.",
