    "objective": "The reduction of radiation exposure in Computed Tomography (CT) remains a pressing medical need in radiology and a major growth opportunity for the medical imaging industry. As part of our ERC research, we have identified a novel method to produce crystalline, photo-sensitive nanowires. These nanowires show a remarkable sensitivity, nearing single-photon detection; about 100 times better than current detectors. This could cause a seismic shift in medical imaging as it will drastically increase the safety of CT and open up many new applications for CT as a modality.\nIn this project, we will assess the commercial feasibility of this novel detector. As part of this study we will investigate the scalability of our technology and characteristics of the market and will develop and implement a sound business strategy.",
