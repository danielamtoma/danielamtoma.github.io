    "objective": "The project will finalize and commercialize a new concept offering open, independent and all-inclusive business services for tire manufacturers. The services include e.g., development of tire materials and mixing processes and training of employees. \nThe first target customers are tire manufacturers in Europe and, at a later stage, on globally. \n\nThe novel business concept provides real and measurable benefits for the customers, i.e. remarkable reduction in the development costs of new energy efficient and environmental friendly rubber materials, compounds and tires. At the moment, the global tire market is about EUR 200 billion annually. EUR 3-6 billion is used for product development. \nAdditionally, there will be indirect savings for society from reduced fuel consumption, increased safety and decreased environmental impact. \n\nIn the Phase 1, feasibility assessment, the business potential of the innovation will be evaluated. The expected outcome is a business plan including market analysis, prospect customer survey and detailed plan for commercialization.",
