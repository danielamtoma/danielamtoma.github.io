    "objective": "The proposal is devoted to the study of a large class of systems of partial differential equations which on one hand appear in classical problems of mathematical physics and on the other hand they provide an efficient tool for description of enumerative invariants in algebraic geometry. These systems are called the hierarchies of topological type or the Dubrovin-Zhang hierarchies. Based on the new approach to such systems, which I suggested recently, I aim to prove certain conjectures about the structure of hierarchies of topological type, describe them explicitly in important examples and also find connections to other areas in the theory of integrable systems.",
