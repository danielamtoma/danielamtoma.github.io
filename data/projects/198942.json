    "objective": "The proposed project aims to put the basis for the commercialization of a new kit for the definitive diagnosis of Sjogren√≠s Syndrome, an autoimmune disease with an high incidence in the population (up to 4%) and characterised by serious complications. \nThe product relies on proteinaceous nanomaterials produced in plants, namely virus-based particles, characterised by superior performance in ELISA tests compared to actual diagnostic systems. \nOne of the main advantages of the proposed product compared to existing ones is that it gets rid of the need of a biopsy procedure for disease diagnosis while increasing the specificity of diagnostic outcomes.\nThe project aims to explore the potential of this novel and high-performing product in the EU and US markets, given that the patent has been already filed and that the actual company asset is already capable of supporting the forecast needs of the kit in the EU market. \nFurthermore, the ? project will help the company in envisaging several aspects before the product commercialization, spamming from a clear definition of the normative procedure for its commercialization in different countries to the set-up of a business strategy for its distribution.",
