    "objective": "M SORA and SILVAPRODUKT, two Slovenian SMEs dedicated to wood products and wood preservation present WINTHERWAX, a passive window made out of Norway spruce (Picea alba).  Itís thermally treated wood is processed through the unique SILVAPRO? patented process, and coated with an innovative preservative wax. \nThe result is a wooden passive window cost-effective (the window will be sold at a price of 369Ä, beating the competitors), highly durable (class 1, more than 25 years fully exposed in the environment), that provides an excellent thermal insulation being highly energy efficient (Thermal transmittance = 0,09 (W/m2K)). It is eco-friendly (its innovative coating, which is a unique biocide-free wax that reduces cracking which is the main cause for wood decay), and with a high aesthetic value (the translucent wax allows this product to preserve the natural look of the wood, in contrast to current oils and varnishes).\nThe aim is to capture 4,1% of the wooden passive window market share from the EU.",
