    "objective": "3bee Hive-Tech is an innovative IoT system designed for monitoring beehives, which ensures the real time analysis of the main parameters of beesí life (from air quality to sound spectrum), helping researchers and beekeepers to identify the main causes of bee disappearance and anomalous beehive behaviours. 3Bee system allows to predict and to prevent the bee death due to environmental and biological factors (pathogens, chemicals pesticides etcÖ), swarming and bee infertility and supports the bee products traceability. Furthermore, it is completely self-sustainable, powered by solar energy and bee vibrations.",
