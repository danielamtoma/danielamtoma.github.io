    "objective": "'The proposed Initial Training Network entitled 'Piezoelectric Energy Harvesters for Self-Powered Automotive Sensors: from\nAdvanced Lead-Free Materials to Smart Systems (ENHANCE)' will provide Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) with broad and\nintensive training within a multidisciplinary research and teaching environment. Key training topics will include development\nof energy harvesters compatible with MEMS technology and able to power wireless sensor. Applied to automobiles, such\ntechnology will allow for 50 kg of weight saving, connection simplification, space reduction, and reduced maintenance costs -\nall major steps towards creating green vehicles. Other important topics include technology innovation, education and\nintellectual asset management.\nENHANCE links world-leading research groups at academic institutions to give a combined, integrated approach of\nsynthesis/fabrication, characterization, modeling/theory linked to concepts for materials integration in devices and systems.\nSuch a science-supported total engineering approach will lead towards efficient piezoelectric energy harvesters viable for the\nautomotive industry. ESRs will focus on this common research objective, applying a multidisciplinary bottom-up approach,\nwhich can be summarized by : 'engineered molecule- advanced material- designed device - smart system'. ENHANCE also\nseeks to intensify the relationship between academic and private sectors, and to train highly skilled young researchers for\nnew materials and device technologies. Both are essential to provide a strong European lead over the rest of the world in\nthis highly competitive industry.'",
