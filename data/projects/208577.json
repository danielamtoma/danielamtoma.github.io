    "objective": "Pyridine and its derivatives are abundant structural motives in nature and widely used in medicinal chemistry. In this research program we propose to develop catalytic enantioselective methods for the synthesis of chiral pyridines with tertiary and quaternary stereocenters through the catalytic addition of readily available and highly reactive organometallics to conjugated alkenyl pyridines. Furthermore, the proposed methodology will be used for the generation of contiguous stereocenters via sequential conjugate addition/Mg-aza-enolate trapping strategies. The synthesis of this kind of chiral compounds will permit further functionalization of pyridine products through the partial or total hydrogenation reactions of aromatic pyridine rings, or the introduction of different electrophiles in various positions of the aromatic ring.",
