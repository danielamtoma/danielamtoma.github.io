    "endDate": "30/11/2017",
    "objective": "STEAM will adopt a novel multidisciplinary approach which utilities the medium of art and creative disciplines to communicate complex STEM concepts to a wide audience.\nThe University of Huddersfield will be the primary site for the STEAM events which will showcase the research ongoing at universities and businesses across the Yorkshire Region, emphasizing specifically the pan-European research with which we are involved. STEAM will create a platform for public interaction through an exciting array of events, fun activities and presentations, where researchers from numerous and diverse disciplines will engage directly.\nThe aim will be to engage with the general public, to illustrate to them the diversity, importance, and impact that this research has on everyday lives, and specifically young people to familiarize them with researchers in person to demystify any misconceptions they may hold and provide strong career role models.\nTwo events are proposed (2016 and 2017) with the STEAM theme running across the two years, developments in research in 2017 will be emphasized to reflect the rapidly evolving nature of science.",
