    "endDate": "31/03/2015",
    "objective": "While Europe undertakes an energy and ecological transition toward cleaner way of producing electricity, transportation and heating remains highly dependent of fossil fuels. We believe that heating systems in Europe could be rapidly transformed into low carbon systems using geothermal sources coupled with efficient heat pump, and that this transformation can be done with great benefit, a reduction of the cost of energy and the use of a well-known almost unlimited resource: the geothermal energy. Technologies are available, the potential is big, regulatory barriers are low, but new players are required to make things change on the market at a greater scale.\n\nSince Fall 2012, Enertime is developing PACíRET, a new concept of industrial high temperature heat pump (above 80∞C) with a high performance proprietary compressor. A conceptual study has been started in 2013, involving university of Liege for support in cycle definition and EPFL in Lausanne for the compressor aero dynamical design. \n\nEnertime wants to perform a feasibility study /market study for its innovative flexible heat pump PACíRET using geothermal energy as primary heat sources in Europe. This study will be conducted with the support of GZB, the International Geothermal Centre based in Bochum, Germany as subcontractor\n\nAhead is the opportunity to transform centralized carbon intensive district heating networks into low carbon distributed District Heating powered by geothermal energy, possibly using also the Heat pump to absorb excess electricity production using the thermal inertia of the District Heating network.",
