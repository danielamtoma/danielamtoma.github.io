    "objective": "The objective of this proposal is the development of a platform of recyclable organocatalysts that could be employed in the preparation of drugs or intermediates thereof. In order to achieve this objective the proposal brings together 3 partners with complementary skills: an expert in Phase Transfer Catalysis, Organo-Catalysis and synthesis (RCSI), an expert in development of DNA based catalysis and DNA elaboration (University of Nottingham) and an expert in the manufacture of polymer bound biomolecules and drug intermediates (Prigen). The relevance of the platform will be demonstrated by the their application to the preparation of unnatural aminoacids, intermediates of synthesis for active pharmaceutical ingredient Pregabalin, a new estrogen-b-receptor modulator and anti-HIV Efavirenz.",
