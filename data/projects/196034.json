    "objective": "The GACD is the first collaboration of international research funding agencies, which aims to coordinate research activities that will address, on a global scale, the prevention and treatment of chronic non-communicable diseases with a particular focus on the needs of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and vulnerable populations in developed countries, with targeted support for researchers in and from these communities. The GACD Secretariat aims to coordinate among the GACD members the next GACD chronic disease research programme and the process for the call for applications, as well as coordinate among the GACD members and participating research teams the joint activities of the research programmes. The recommendations reached are expected to have a fundamental value for the future orientation of public health research policy.",
