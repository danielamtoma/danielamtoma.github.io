    "objective": "The proposed action aims to support a promising young researcher so that he can move to an internationally active group and develop various skills. The proposed research concerns distributed control and smart grids. Distributed control is a topic of intense research and the available results are focused on stabilization while optimization in this setting is inherently difficult. Smart grids are an emergent technology for the efficient and robust integration of distributed generation sources and controlled loads. The proposed research aims to produce both theoretical results in distributed control and concrete control techniques for smart grids. Major issues to be investigated are heterogeneity and uncertainty as in practice not all subsystems are identical and their characteristics are a priori unknown. Therefore the controllers should learn the system, adapt to changes and take into account any differences among the subsystems. A goal of the proposed research is to provide globally optimal solutions. The importance of coordinating units will be investigated. These questions are both important for theory and relevant to smart grids. The problem of uncertainty will be addressed using techniques from estimation theory and system identification. The objective of global optimization will be addressed using global search methods. Both the hosting team and the young researcher have prior work closely related to the proposed research. Suitable dissemination and public outreach activities have been planned. Appropriateness of environment and supervisor are clearly documented in this proposal as well as the bi-directional transfer of knowledge. Instrumental is a three months secondment in a company specializing in smart grid solutions, where the researcher will have the opportunity to apply the developed techniques. This action will establish him as a mature and independent researcher and will provide him excellent career perspectives in the European academic sector.",
