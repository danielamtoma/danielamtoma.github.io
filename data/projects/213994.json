    "startDate": "16/07/2018",
    "endDate": "15/07/2020",
    "objective": "The Experienced Researcher (ER), Dr Amuthachelvi Daniel, who is at the centre of this application, will, through this MSCA Fellowship, enhance her research and innovation potential through advanced training and international and inter-sectoral mobility. RAMAN-Dx will develop methods for detecting pre-malignant oral lesions using Raman spectroscopy of minimally invasive exfoliated cell and saliva samples.  The ERÃ­s skills in instrument and software development and patient testing will complement the expertise of the host laboratory, Radiation and Environmental Science Centre (RESC) at Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT), led by Prof. Fiona Lyng.  The ER will receive both research and professional development and leadership training and will undertake a secondment at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd which will facilitate her career goal to become a world leading researcher in the field of biophotonics.",
