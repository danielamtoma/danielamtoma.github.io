    "objective": "Europe is the worldís largest manufacturer of machine tools but this position is threatened due to the emergence of Asian countries. However, Europe has world-class capabilities in the manufacture of high-value parts for such competitive sectors like aerospace & automotive and this has led to the creation of a high-technology, high-skill industry. European machine tool builders, part manufacturers and other agents have to work together to increase the competitiveness of European manufacturing industry.\nSimulation tools are currently a key complement to European machine tool industry expertise but new integrated approaches are needed. The main objective of Twin-Control is the development of a simulation and control system that integrates the different aspects that affect machine tool and machining performance. This holistic approach will allow a better estimation of machining performance than single featured simulation packages, including lifecycle concepts like energy consumption and end-life of components. This integrated concept will also enhance the necessary collaboration between machine tool builders and part manufacturers.\nThe specific industrial objectives are:\nï         Getting machines that work as designed faster (10% reduction)\nï         Getting production processes that work as planned faster (20% reduction)\nï         To get a first-time-right part manufacturing (75%)\nï         To increase production time trough model-based control (increase of 1-2%)\nï         To reduce energy consumption (25-50%)\nï         Improve machine reliability and increase machine up-time due to a proactive maintenance (2-4.5%)\nAll these will contribute to reduce machine tool life cycle costs (15 %) with a reduction of O&M costs in the range of 25%.\nThe project considers the validation and demonstrator in real production scenarios in aerospace and automotive industries. Added to this, 3 demonstrators will be set-up in three pilot lines for spreading results beyond the project end",
