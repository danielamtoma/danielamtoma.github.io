    "objective": "The objective of the proposal is to develop a process for large-scale fabrication of a novel class of cellulose-based photonic pigments, which will replace traditional, potentially hazardous colorants that are currently used in industry for cosmetics, food, textiles and security labelling. These novel photonic pigments consist of micron-sized spherical particles composed of naturally-derived cellulose nanocrystals.  Within the remit of the ERC StG SeSaMe, it has been demonstrated that cellulose nanocrystals can self-assemble in aqueous droplets, forming dry microparticles, where the crystals are organised in chiral nematic ordered shells, capable of reflecting light of a specific colour. \nScaling up the fabrication of such photonic cellulose pigments will allow to manufacture a truly sustainable, biocompatible and potentially edible alternative to conventional synthetic dyes for mass-market applications.",
