    "objective": "The need: Today, although over 6M people suffer from Parkinson's and related diseases worldwide we have no objective early diagnostic test. By the time patients present the symptoms that lead to diagnosis the disease is already very advanced and the options for treatment extremely limited. This has an enormous impact on cost of care and an even greater impact on patient and carer quality of life. An early diagnostic test will revolutionise treatment in terms of slowing disease evolution and improved outcomes, with fewer years in the advanced phases of the disease requiring expensive full-time care. \nOur goal: We aim to commercialise non-invasive, very low-cost preclinical electroencephalograph (EEG) biomarkers for synucleinopathies (Parkinson Disease - PD and Lewy Body Dementia - LBD), which will have real impact on both quality of life and cost of care.",
