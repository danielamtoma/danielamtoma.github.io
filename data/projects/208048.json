    "startDate": "01/02/2017",
    "endDate": "31/07/2019",
    "objective": "SMART-LAYUP activities described in the present proposal will contribute to develop and validate an advanced process of hybrid materials automated lay-up for manufacturing of regional aircraft composite fuselage which allows a significant reduction of the overall production costs and manufacturing flow. After a developmental phase to be performed at MTORRES site, the innovative process and related machine will be validated and costs assessed through the execution of dedicated lay-up tests and fabrication of fuselage demonstrators at Topic Manager plant.",
