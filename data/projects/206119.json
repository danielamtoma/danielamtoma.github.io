    "objective": "The detection of gravitational waves is expected within the decade and it will start a new era in astronomy. A limiting factor for all earth-based gravitational-wave detectors is isolation from ground motion that limits both low frequency sensitivity and detector operation. We propose to develop a new kind of extremely low-noise inertial sensors using laser-interferometer readout that can drastically improve active seismic isolation systems. The interferometric readout developed at Birmingham has low noise, huge dynamic range, and highly linear readout. This combination of properties allows a radical redesign and simplification of the mechanical components of an inertial sensor, and the removal of many common sources of noise. The technology required to build these sensors has many potential applications outside the field. The experienced researcher, Dr Mow-Lowry, will lead the experimental work and manage the project under the guidance of Professor Freise, and by the end of the proposal he will have proven his ability to deliver key instrumentation, making the transition from scientific contributor to principal investigator. In the years following, he will be ideally placed to exploit the project outcomes through scientific collaboration and commercialisation.",
