    "startDate": "01/03/2016",
    "endDate": "29/02/2020",
    "objective": "A diverse variety of medical or lifestyle conditions lead to a progressive loss of muscle force by functionally impairing myofibril contractility and causing ultimately myofibril loss. Major underlying risk factors of chronic muscle force loss are ageing, inactive lifestyles, and unbalanced nutrition. Together, these factors are predicted to lead to an endemic incidence of muscle weakness both in the developed countries. Clinical research on the mechanisms involved requires a multidisciplinary approach covering aspects of ageing, metabolism, and on the humoral cross-talk of muscle with other key organs including heart, liver, kidney, and lung.  To achieve this, six European groups with complementary expertise in inter-organ-cross-talk during stress-induced secondary myopathies will team-up with a leading team in the U.S. with expertise in the translation of muscle research into therapeutic interventions, and with one team from South Africa with cutting-edge expertise in the regulation of regenerative capacities in muscle. \nImportantly, four SMEs will participate in this RISE network that provide expertise in early muscle disease detection, monitoring, and the developing preventive strategies: Their knowledge on muscle disease detection at early stages and their monitoring during interventions will promote translational innovation. To implement innovation and our joint research program, both early stage and advanced researchers will be seconded from the academic eight teams to these four SMEs and vice versa. Thereby, this RISE scheme will establish a long-term collaborative University-SME driven translational innovative research program innovation in our interdisciplinary field of growing socioeconomic medical importance.",
