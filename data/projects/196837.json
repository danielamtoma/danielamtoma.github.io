    "objective": "Sport Infinity aims to identify and develop innovative partly waste-based long-fibre reinforced composites  enabling the automatic production of easily customisable plastic sports goods. The project will focus on the production of balls and shoes and will adopt a design-driven approach exploiting the automation potential of rotation moulding processes, which offer significant design freedom. The innovation potential of the moulding processes to be employed originates from their capacity of bonding together a multitude of different materials, while effecting external product shaping without using glue and/or other adhesives. The starting point is the development of composite materials superimposed in the form of layers in variable ways according to the targeted (custom) shape and the required properties. The insertion of decorative elements in the mould will enable design custom designs, along with 3D printing. An end-to-end collaborative design innovation will be adopted. The Sport Infinity consortium gathers expertise across the value chain from design to material development, production, marketing and distribution and across multiple disciplines industrial design, material science, recycling and industrial processes. The new flexible automatic production, can set a paradigm of competitive production Made in Europe favouring ranging from modular factories to in-store production cells.",
