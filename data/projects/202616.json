    "objective": "Our consortium is applying for the Engine Mounts System (EMS) of the Ultra High Propulsive Efficiency. Our 3 objectives are:\n1. Assist the Engine Manufacturer & the Airframer in the evaluation & selection of the most promising & suitable Engine Mounts System (EMS) configuration. Criteria for evaluation: weight, cost, dynamic performance, certification, impact on engine & aircraft assembly.\n2. Design, build, & test the selected concept for the Ground Test (GT) that is planned to validate study predictions & performances. Our intent is to develop solutions & technologies to minimize weight, reduce manufacturing process complexity, improve system dynamic performance, increase reliability, & provide continuous monitoring of system health & usage & measure in-flight EMS conditions & loads. The plan includes new solutions & technologies with a min. TRL 4 at CDR in order to advance to TRL 5, 6 at GT incl. EMS overall configuration validation & component optimization.\n3. To develop & insert new solutions for ground test with lower TRLís than 4 at CDR as parallel activities. These lower TRL solutions selected on their potential to provide a significant leap in the performance, manufacturing, & assembly.\nOur consortium consists of\n1. international company with global reach & renown experience in the EMS industry, LORD Corp\n2. a German SME, excelling in manufacturing of aerospace structures, HEGGEMANN\n3. an Italian consulting SME in the field of structural mechanics, Vicoter\n4. an Italian University, one of the leading science & technology universities in Europe, Politecnico di Milano\nThis consortium set up a Work Plan starting in 3Q 2015 for a duration of 72 months, which is divided into 7 Work Packages, :\nï WP1: Management & reporting \nï WP2: Concept Studies & EMS Specification definition \nï WP3: GT Design & Development \nï WP4: GT Manufacturing & Delivery \nï WP5: GT Qualification & Testing \nï WP6: Support for Engine GT \nï WP7: Innovation & new Technologies development",
