    "objective": "In this project, we plan to undergo the necessary steps to commercialize a SR microscope, the Hermes SR, as a result of the outcomes of the ongoing CellViewer FET open project. Our CellViewer project aims to design a SR microscope prototype that will allow us to visualize in single cells, in parallel, at the systems level, DNA, mRNAs and proteins with nanoscale resolution. This prototype will have automated workflow and data acquisition enabling collecting large datasets of consistent high quality with unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution. In view of the current design of the automated SR microscopy prototype from the original CellViewer FET project and the exiting strong connections to the Hermes system already commercialized by IDEA Bio, we want to explore the market potential for the CellViewer demonstrator and define the path to the market of the Hermes SR. For this, we plan to: i) build the Hermes SR by adding the SR units developed by CellViewer, ii) conduct a market research and product characterisation of the Hermes SR that enables its advantages over the competitors, ii) develop an IP strategy, iii) develop a work plan to finally develop de Hermes SR, and iv) prepare a business and financial plan.",
