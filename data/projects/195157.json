    "objective": "Justification of relationships between foods and health is significantly limited by lack of versatile and accurate analytical tools. Metabolomics has in a few years revealed many novel food intake biomarkers but only few of these markers have been validated and applied in clinical settings. The primary aim of the proposed work at Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports (NEXS) is to identify, validate and methodologically combine a large number of biomarkers, covering broadly common foods, beverages, and supplements to provide a robust and objective tool to assess recent dietary intakes. The dietary assessment tool will be thoroughly validated through application to fully dietary controlled studies and to studies where the current subjective instruments have been applied. My new objective tool will help compliance assessment in clinical trials, observational studies and in the care of patients with food-related disorders. This is timely because all current instruments are subjective and have major flaws when applied to e.g. causes of overweight and failing dietary interventions. The host institution has a strong background in metabolomics, biomarker development, human trials and studies of weight loss and is internationally highly recognized within the nutrition area. My proposal includes several innovative features for dietary assessment and analytics and through advanced training provides me ample skills acquisition such as advanced analytical method development, data analysis, statistics, networking, project management, etc. of major importance for my research career plans.",
