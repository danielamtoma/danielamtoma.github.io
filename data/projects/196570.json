    "objective": "A new optical interferometry technology has been developed which delivers fast and high precision areal surface measurements for stepped and structured micro-nanoscale surfaces which cannot be measured by traditional techniques. The technology addresses the market need for high throughput, simple sample preparation and nanoscale accuracy combined with an affordable system cost. Furthermore, a unique vibration isolation innovation means that it has the flexibility to be applied both in-line and in-process. This project aims to validate its commercial potential as both a research and industrial metrology tool.",
