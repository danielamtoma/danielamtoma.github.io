    "objective": "The overall objective of the TAIS project is to develop and demonstrate an efficient way for Councils to manage and\nimplement HandHelds in the normal day to day operations of their Civil Enforcement Officers, by using existing technology which is cheaper and more efficient that older style systems that Council presently use.\nThe specific project objectives (POs) of the project are to:\nPO1. Identify and test the most suitable Mobile phone operating system with the longest battery life\nPO2. Identify and develop the best process for utilising the GPS on the phone to relay the signal on a minute by minute\nbasis whilst reducing the battery consumption by 25%\nPO3. Use open cross-platform communication protocols to develop an API that will link into the Compliance Display Map\n(CDM)\nPO4. Develop an Automatic Number Plate Reader that will allow real time look ups from a centralised database\nPO5. Develop an API that will link into Back Office of pre-existing suppliers with the minimum of effort and the lowest cost\nPO6. Identify and develop the best mechanism for robustness and ease of use that does not require the final users to have\ndeep knowledge of the underlying IT infrastructure.\nPO7. Develop a reporting algorithm that will monitor each transaction which will ensure accountability as well as shortfalls\nwhere further training is required\nPO8. Develop a Control Panel usable by an Administrator which will ensure that all Data Protection issues are complied with\nand which can easily be exported to a third party in the event of an enquiry\nPO9. Reduce carbon footprint of ìcruising vehiclesî looking for parking by ensuring that overstayers will vacate their parking\nbay on time due to possibility of enforceable action\nPO10. To increase the number of vehicles checked per hour by parking attendants by at least 300%\nPO11. To increase the accuracy of parking checks by attendants, thus reducing mis-reads by at least 30%.",
