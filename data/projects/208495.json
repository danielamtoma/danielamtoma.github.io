    "objective": "Current 3D microscopy methods are limited in speed due to the need to scan the sample in the optical axis. Multifocus microscopy - or MFM- is a method that allows for the instant acquisition of a 3D volume without scanning, thus increasing acquisition speed by a factor of 10-100. MFM based on diffractive optics allows for easy optimization of the total volume acquired and the sampling rate. In our ERC-StG project, we developed an important expertise in the design and construction of diffractive elements key to MFM and invented a novel super-resolution imaging method based on this technology (patent pending). In this project, we propose to further improve the conception and fabrication methods of MFMÃ­s diffractive elements to considerably improve acquisition speed and resolution. In addition, we will employ these technologies in conjunction with valve-based microfluidics to develop and validate a microscopy-based high-resolution, high-throughput cell profiler (Hi2M). Hi2M will allow for the 3D acquisition of complete cell volumes in <10 ms, enabling the high-resolution, multi-color imaging of millions of cells/hour without the need for cell adhesion. Because of these important advantages over existing microscopies, we anticipate that the technologies developed in InstantScope should have a large impact in many fields of cell biology.",
