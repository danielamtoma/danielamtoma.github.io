    "objective": "We are yet again at a critical stage for Europe. With the threat of geopolitical instability coming from several dimensions Europe needs to not just assert its presence on the world stage, but moreover needs to assert its digital sovereignty to further its vision of a single digital market. The need for a European leadership role for the Next Generation Internet is clear.\nNGI MOVE is to inspire Europe to become a leader in the co-creation of the NGI in a more human centric, societal and economic beneficial ecosystem of researchers, high tech start-ups, industrial and government leaders as well as grassroots communities and individuals.\n\nThe vision is to create a NGI that is at the service of people and stimulates business opportunities, centred on European values and competing globally. Our message is pragmatic cybernetics, balancing extreme centralisation and extreme decentralization where data stays with citizens.\n\nThe main activities of the project are driven by the following activities:\nConnecting the Next Generation Internet Ecosystem is the primary activity, in that it identifies and engages with the most brilliant researchers, entrepreneurs and individuals.\n\nCo-creating the Next Generation Internet Ecosystem is all about creating content that fuels the community and motivates people to engage. Three sub-activities are to co-create: (1) the organisational model around the NGI flagship initiative. (2) the concepts and models that make up the characteristics for the NGI flagship initiative. (3) a number of NGI scenarios that can drive a vision and common basis for discussion amongst the many diverse stakeholders.\n\nThe final activity is to launch the NGI Ecosystem. In essence this is the tangible outcome of the project that provides the basis for the NGI flagship initiative beyond H2020. In essence it delivers a brand, a model organisation and set of tools to support the ecosystem as well as the people that are active participants in shaping the NGI.",
