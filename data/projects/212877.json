    "objective": "Migration and the characteristics which constitute its parameters, dynamics and complexities comprises one of the most paramount matters in contemporary Europe. Under these designated circumstances, the necessity of relevant, concise, and useful knowledge are prerequisites for the design of efficient and constructive policies. Although particular databases such as EUROSTAT and OECD offer valuable insights into these migratory dynamics, a comprehensive, efficient and integrative database which synthesizes, categorizes and maps out the vast analytical accounts on migration throughout Europe is non-existent. This project, bringing together 16 leading research institutions, networks and policy institutes throughout Europe, aims to proficiently fulfill this gap crucial for policy-purposes through the construction of a central migration hub. This hub will be of instrumental value due to its capability to operate as a key grammar in the design of current and future policy. Essentially, it accumulates and consolidates past, present and future migration research through providing an extensive yet succinct overview of migration drivers, infrastructures, flows, and policies, allowing for an improved systematic understanding of the factors that constitute the interaction between these analytical categories. The accessibility, accumulation and integration of research in one hub will be an integral element for improved policy making as it concentrates and visualizes relevant data Ã± thereby facilitating information acquisition in pursuance of policy oriented goals. As of such, a continuous research-policy dialogue is prevalent throughout the construction of the hub, an insight which enables its users to visualize and develop migration scenarios- entailing a classification system for migration research.  Consequently, the project aims to shape a strategic research agenda on migration as it will identify gaps, overlaps and connections within the available stock of migration research",
