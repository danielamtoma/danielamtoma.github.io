    "objective": "Large scale antenna array (LSAA) has been introduced into 5G cellular networks to address the capacity crunch indoors. LSAAs will increase the physical dimension of the base station (BS), generating negative consequences on weight, wind load and visual impact. A potential solution of deploying LSAA indoors is to embed it into building structures, e.g., concrete walls. However, how the concrete impacts the wireless performance of concrete embedded antenna array (CEAA) has not been well studied. In this project, we will investigate how the electromagnetic (EM) properties of concrete will impact the wireless performance of CEAAs, and how to design and optimise the building properties of concrete to achieve both desirable mechanical and wireless performance. First, we will define metrics so that the wireless performance of CEAA can be measured. EM properties of concrete and the inhomogeneity of EM properties will be taken into account. Then, we will establish the relationship between the ratio and layout of admixtures and the EM properties of concrete. Three simplified concrete model, i.e., multilayer, lattice and 3D Poisson point process (PPP) models, will be proposed and verified through simulations and measurements. Finally, we will design concrete with desirable EM properties by changing the ratio and layout of admixtures under the constraint of mechanical performance to obtain an optimal wireless performance. After the completion of this project, we will be able tell how to optimize wireless performance of concrete under the constraint of its mechanical performance for typical building structures.",
