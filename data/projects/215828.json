    "objective": "The goal of MEDISS is to identify medical imaging applications for a device developed and validated for quantum applications within the FET project SUPERTWIN. Optical techniques are quickly gaining ground in medical imaging because they enable non-invasive imaging along with identification of specific molecules while avoiding any ionization in contrast to, for instance, X-rays. For diagnostics, as well as to monitor emerging photo-therapies targeting cancer cells, optical characterization tools with high efficiency, low noise, high time resolution and high sensitivity in the near-infrared are required. The detectors developed by Single Quantum for advanced multi-channel quantum optics correlation measurements in the project SUPERTWIN represent an ideal solution for medical imaging in the near infrared. In MEDISS, we will demonstrate the usefulness of our quantum sensors for bio-medical applications with a dedicated prototype, we will interact with medical experts and will establish a business plan to enter the medical imaging market.",
