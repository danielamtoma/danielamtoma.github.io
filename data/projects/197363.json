    "objective": "'The general objective of the proposed project is to develop ìCOGEM CPVî, an innovative heatspreader to be taken in the context of High Concentration Photovoltaic (HCPV) technology, through the adoption of new materials, particularly ceramics, that allow a reduction of energy production costs of about 25%, and an improvement on the performance at least of 3%.\nIn particular, the innovative system, through the use of the new components / materials / technologies, will achieve the reduction of production costs ó due to the elimination of some components and some assembly process; the improvement of performance ó due to the reduction in cell operating temperature. The objective of Solergy, through the proposed innovation, is to introduce a new approach to HCPV resolving common issues and enabling HCPV to take its rightful place as the solar technology of choice for sunny regions. ìCOGEM CPV' could be consider the worldís first field upgradeable, 40\\ year lifetime High Concentration Photovoltaic (HCPV) system.'",
