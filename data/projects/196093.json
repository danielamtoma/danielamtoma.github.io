    "objective": "The Experienced Researcher (ER), Dr Shiyamala Duraipandian, who is at the centre of this application, will, through this MSCA Fellowship, enhance her research and innovation potential through advanced training, international and inter-sectoral mobility. The ER will develop methods for detecting high risk HPV infection and dysplasia using Raman spectroscopy in cervical cells collected during routine Pap smear screening.  Her skills in instrument and software development and patient testing will complement the expertise of the host laboratory. During the project measurable knowledge transfer towards the ER will be facilitated through DITÃ­s Postdoctoral Training Programme, RESC induction and specialist skills transfer, strengthened academic and industry network contacts, via existing networks and industry events, and preparation of a dedicated career development plan.",
