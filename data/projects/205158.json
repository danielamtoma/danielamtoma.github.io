INVENTORY is targeted to 22 million SMEs in the EU who are seeking for opportunities to expand their client base and find new suppliers to optimize costs. As the outcome, the INVENTORY project increases visibility and competitiveness of SMEs on the EU market by creating conditions for an efficient market. \n\nINVENTORY provides product recognition systems, standardised and comparable product information, real-time automated inventory management, deposit service, extensive compatibility with other software and simple set-up. These are all essential characteristics of an efficient and effective marketplace that current European market lacks.\n\nThe objective of the feasibility study is to identify and assess technical and commercial feasibility of INVENTORY.
