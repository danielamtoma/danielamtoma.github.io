    "title": "Pharmacophore guided diversity-oriented synthesis and its application in discovering inhibitors of protein-protein interactions between RAD51 and BRCA2",
    "startDate": "01/06/2015",
    "endDate": "31/05/2017",
    "objective": "The proposed research aims at discovering inhibitors of protein-protein interaction (PPI) between RAD51 and BRCA2 as a promising treatment of cancer, in particular to reverse the resistance of cancer cells to radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy. The pharmacophore guided DOS approach developed in this project has the potential to be a general method for rational discovery of PPI modulators. The researcher will acquire novel technologies and develop new skills in both scientific and management aspects, which are important in his professional maturity and career plans; while the host can also be benefitted from his experience in medicinal chemistry. This action will promote the mobility inside the European Research Area and spark lasting cooperation among different European countries.",
