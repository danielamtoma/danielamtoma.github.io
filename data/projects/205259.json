    "objective": "SymbiCoat is a new surface-bonded biocide that combines the potency of two different types of antimicrobials. SymbiCoat excels in kill kinetics, performance duration and low toxicity and does not induce antimicrobial resistance.  SymbiCoat also allows rapid and easy recharge of the antimicrobial function, saving time and costs as a result that no competing biocide technology could provide. SymbiCoat is able to bring the advantages of the biocide coating technologies to previously inaccessible industries, like the food industry. In fact, thanks to its negligible toxicity and high efficacy, SymbiCoat can be applied to any sensible surface, including food-contact surfaces in the food processing equipment. Thus, SymbiCoat has the potential to radically enhance the contamination control in the food industry, helping prevent the spread of resistant bacteria and foodborne diseases.",
