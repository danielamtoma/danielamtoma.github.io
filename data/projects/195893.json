    "title": "Organocatalysis at the service of total synthesis: Madangamine alkaloids",
    "startDate": "27/04/2015",
    "endDate": "26/04/2017",
    "objective": "This project will develop a new, highly enantioselective, state-of-the-art synthetic route to the madangamine alkaloids B, C and E based on a novel organocatalytic desymmetrization reaction as a key step, which will allow the rapid and efficient construction of the BC rings ready for subsequent advancement to the majority of the family members. Evaluation of the anti-cancer biological activity of the different madangamines and late stage intermediates will be carried out. This Fellowship project combines total synthesis, new asymmetric methodology development via organocatalysis and biological evaluation. It has been designed to augment and complement the research and transferable skills sets of the Marie Curie fellow, and will greatly enhance his career prospects accordingly. Through the training and the research results arising, the Fellowship will be beneficial to the fellow, the host institution and European science.",
