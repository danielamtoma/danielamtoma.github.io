    "objective": "The FAME project aims to develop and demonstrate an innovative system for qualitative food content analysis in liquid food samples, based on the Fourier-Transform Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-NIR) method. The new system will be the first food analyser in any technology that can be used for taking advanced laboratory-type measurements of higher precision and on a wider number of parameters directly in the production line (continuous in-line measurements). Moreover, the instrument makes it possible to do measurements in more than one production location at the same time, as well as operate simultaneously in the production line and in the lab environment. This unique combination, together with the superior precision and versatility of analysis offered by our patented FT-NIR solution will open up new possibilities for food and beverage producers to have a complete control of their production process at any time, thus ensuring the highest standards in food quality and safety as well as reducing costs and increasing their efficiency in production.",
