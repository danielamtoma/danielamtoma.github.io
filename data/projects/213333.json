    "objective": "Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is considered one of the deadliest forms of cancer. CRC incidence and mortality can be reduced through screening. However, screening participation remains suboptimal worldwide, and though early screening is highly encouraged, more than hundreds of thousands die of the disease every year i.e. 50K people died only in The US in 2015. Screening for CRC is the process of identifying polyps that appear years before the appearance of symptoms of the disease. Several tests can be used to screen for colorectal cancers. These tests can be divided into: 1. Tests that can find both colorectal polyps and cancer: These tests look at the structure of the colon itself to find any abnormal areas. This is done either with a scope put into the rectum or with special imaging (x-ray) tests. Polyps found during these tests can be removed before they become cancerous, so these tests may prevent colorectal cancer. These tests are effective but suffer from low compliance. 2. Tests that mainly find markers for cancer: These tests check the stool (faeces) for signs of cancer (usually blood). These tests are simpler, but less accurate and also suffer from low compliance However, currently these tests for early screening CRC suffer from 3 main problems and limitations: 1. Present low accuracy: can miss information (may fail in the detection of polyps, cover partially parts of the colon, false positives, etc.) 2. Create discomfort (Sedation may be needed, side effects Ã±i.e. bloating, cramping- are usual) 3. May require stool handling that leads to low compliance. Clearly, there is a real need for a more accurate and less invasive test that will also increase compliance. Outsense product is built over a successful methodology with 3 fundamental pillars: (i) Optical method with high sensitivity and accuracy through the realization of multiple repetitive tests (ii) seamless solution, not requiring any stool handling, expected to lead to higher compliance (iii) direct commun",
