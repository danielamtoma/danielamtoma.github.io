    "objective": "The aim of this project is to bring together subject matter experts from the academic and non-academic sectors to develop a platform of ìgreenî chemoenzymatic methods for the production of high value active pharmaceutical ingredients ñ  both those currently on the market, and those in development pipelines of the Pharma industry.  The partners will exemplify the use of the platform through its application in the production of 4 drugs currently on the market ñ namely Duloxetine, Atomexetine, Ramosetron and Paricalcitol.\nIn order to achieve this objective the proposal brings together 3 partners with complementary skills:\nKelada Pharmachem: Phase transfer catalysis/organo catalysis/scale-up  of chemical processes\nCerbios Pharma: Biocatalysis and fermentation methodologies for drug production\nIC-CNR: Protein crystallography and enzymatic engineering",
