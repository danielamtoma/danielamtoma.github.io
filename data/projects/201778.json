    "objective": "In relation to the food frying process, QUALITYFRY has developed a new that improves significantly its limiting factors:\n- Healthiness: Minimises the oil degradation and the oil absorption by food\n- Organoleptic quality: Eliminates smell/flavour transfers and improves the food texture\n- Safety: Avoids hot oil projections\n- Costs: Minimises the oil consumption, energy consumption, and eliminates the dependence of fume and odour extraction\nand fire protection installations and their maintenance.\nThanks to the new frying technology developed by QUALITYFRY, not only a significant improvement of the frying quality and safety of the process is achieved but also the absorption of oil by the food has been reduced up to a 40% and annually savings in terms of operating costs up to a 65%. The new designed process provides the equipment with a huge flexibility since an extraction installation is not needed. This means that the equipment could be installed in any place, relevant consideration for the segment of the vending.",
