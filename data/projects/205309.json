    "objective": "The Peroxiredoxin proteins represent a currently untapped molecular therapeutic target. We recently characterised a range\nof novel chemical compounds that could alter the function of one of the peroxiredoxin family members, peroxiredoxin 4\n(PRDX4). The approach involved high-throughput computational ìvirtualî compound screening involving our supercomputer\nfacility at the University of Cambridge. Given our success in finding chemicals that could affect the function of these\nproteins, we would now like to screen and provide proof-of-principle evidence of the efficacy of novel compounds for further\ndevelopment as therapeutic agents.\n\nThis process has been very rapid for prototyping novel molecules, from idea to hit compound validation in biological assays\nin less than 6 months. This rapid development cycle is highly cost-efficient and produces a range of chemical ìhitsî that\ncould subsequently be taken forward as ìleadî compounds for pre-clinical and clinical studies in the future, as novel\ntherapeutics for a range of diseases ranging from cardiovascular and metabolic disease to cancer.",
