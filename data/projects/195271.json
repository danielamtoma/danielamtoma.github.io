    "startDate": "01/04/2015",
    "endDate": "31/03/2018",
    "objective": "Chemical synthesis through the activation of inert C-H bonds allows scientist to efficiently assemble complex organic molecules which have specific function. We aim to develop a novel class of metalloenzymes, where a transition metal catalyst is embedded into a genetically engineered protein, for rhodium catalysed asymmetric C-H activation reactions. We believe that the approach of incorporating a transition metal into a protein will allow for precise control of the chemical environment around the transition metal, allowing us to control many key outcomes of the chemical reaction such as enantioselectivity, regioselectivity and reaction rates. This technology will allow for the development of C-H activation reactions that have previously been inaccessible to the synthetic chemistry community.",
