    "objective": "Microwave ablation produces a small and highly controllable heating zone, ideal for the thermal treatment of a range of medical conditions where damage to adjacent structures is a significant risk.\nPotential applications range from the treatment of small soft-tissue cancers to the management of various venous disorders. The DRAIOCHT project will involve the design, development and pre-clinical evaluation of a novel microwave ablation device for the treatment of disorders of the venous system. The proposed device will provide a new low cost therapeutic medical device, that places greater value on the protection of crucial functional tissue and nerves compared to current ablation devices on the market. The project is of significant economic and societal benefits due to the high prevalence of venous diseases in Europe.",
