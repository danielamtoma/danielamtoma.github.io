    "objective": "Nanoparticles (NPs), metal particles of less than 100nm, are increasingly emitted to the environment from a variety of anthropogenic sources. However, their toxic effects on living organisms, capacity to enter the food chain, and impact in environmental health are poorly understood. NANOREM is a research project aiming to provide the first comprehensive insight into the toxicity of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles in wetland plants. This information is essential to evaluate correctly the risk of releasing large quantities of NPs to the environment. In this project we will make use of cutting edge isotope techniques to trace the sources of NP pollution, and to understand how NPs might change the current paradigm of metal cycling and assimilation by plants. Furthermore, NPs will be synthesized from plants and plant extracts using novel methods, and fully characterized.",
