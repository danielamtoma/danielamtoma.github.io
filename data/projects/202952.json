    "objective": "The bacterial cell cycle is of fundamental importance and an important potential antibiotic target; however, many details of\nthe molecular mechanisms involved remain elusive. Sporulation in Bacillus subtilis is an important model system for cell\ncycle studies. Here, I propose applying the ribosome profiling method, not only to identify novel factors involved in the of B.\nsubtilis cell cycle, but also to create a map of factors regulating this process. I will use advanced genetic methods and\nmicroscopic techniques to characterize the functions of the novel factors, gaining insights into their role in the cell cycle. My\nextensive experience in prokaryotic translation gained in the laboratory of Dr. Daniel Wilson in Munich, Germany, combined\nwith the exceptional genetics and cell biology expertise of the laboratory of Prof. Jeff Errington in Newcastle, England,\ncreates a great opportunity to study important fundamental aspects of bacteria, with potential implications for healthcare,\ndrug discovery and industrial biotechnology, as well as providing the foundation for a successful independent career in\nscience.",
