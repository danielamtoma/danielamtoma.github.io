    "objective": "The main goal of GTRACK is to demonstrate a semi-transparent eye-tracking system that is disposed in the line of sight of the user, for portable applications. To this end, we will use hybrid Quantum Dot ñ Graphene photodetectors. \n\nEye-tracking existed since the 1800ís, but is expected to appear abundantly in our daily lives with the advent of virtual and augmented reality. In the existing systems, the camera has to be placed sufficiently close to the eye to capture enough IR light at sufficiently high resolution, while not blocking the userís vision. By placing the camera directly on the lens, all these disadvantages are circumvented. Moreover, larger detectors can increase the sensitivity of the detectors and hence decrease the power consumption of the active illumination, which would allow for portable applications.",
