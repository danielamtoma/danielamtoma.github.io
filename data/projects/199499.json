    "objective": "Scandecon짜s innovation project aims at bringing the next generation technology and methodology for environmental dredging to the market. The core of Scandecon짜s solution is a unique freeze technology that uses 75 % less power, shortens the time for freezing by 50 % and lowers costs by 30 % compared to other dredging methods. This is combined with a set of services that covers the entire value-chain for dredging, handling and disposal of contaminated sediment - making it a unique offer that sets a new standard for environmental dredging. Scandecon짜s solution will initiate a paradigm shift in environmental dredging by allowing for new possibilities for cost-, time- and resource efficient removal of contaminated sediment at levels that can endanger marine life and human life. Applying Scandecon짜s technology on polluted environments in soil, rivers, lakes and oceans will help states, municipalities and businesses to save hundreds of millions of Euro on dredging and handling of contaminated sediment.",
