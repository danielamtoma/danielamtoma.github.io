    "objective": "This project concerns research on the frontier between discrete mathematics and computer science, and focuses on studying properties of randomly behaving discrete structures. Specifically, it studies quasi-random properties of k-uniform hypergraphs by using a combination of  hypergraph regularity methods and flag algebras. The properties the project will be mainly focused on are containments and counting small substructures in large quasi-random hypergraphs. These questions are closely related to problems from other areas such as number theory, algorithm design, and property testing.",
