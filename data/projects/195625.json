    "objective": "Air transportation is a crucial contributor to the world economy, and thus its continued growth is essential. However, environmental impact and the increase in fuel prices make sustainable aviation a challenge. To address this challenge, we propose to develop state-of-the-art computational tools for the design optimization of next-generation airliners with unprecedented fuel efficiency. We will achieve this by leveraging the expertise of the researcher on high-fidelity computational design of aircraft, together with Airbus√≠ vast experience in practical aircraft design, and the network of academics at ISAE. The proposed research is expected to make a lasting impact at Airbus by implementing new computational tools, and by developing design concepts for the next-generation of aircraft.",
