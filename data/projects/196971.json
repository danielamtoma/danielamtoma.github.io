    "startDate": "01/09/2015",
    "endDate": "28/02/2019",
    "objective": "There is an innovative need for more efficient and reliable damage inspection, reducing time and cost of aircraft infrastructures, as well as maintenance-especially C and D Checks- without compromising the safety of passengers and goods transported. The CompInnova project is focused upon the development of an innovative inspection methodology, with automated and manual capabilities, for any type of composite and metallic aircraft structures. The novel structural integrity approach is comprised by three parts: a qualified Phased Array (PA) and Infrared Thermography (IRT) method attached to a mobile Vortex robot, a Damage Tolerance (DT) structural integrity assessment technique processed on a computer and an innovative repair system.",
