    "objective": "Flat bands allow to increase the critical temperature of the superconducting transition thanks\nto their high density of states. However a characterization of the flat bands that support a finite\nsupercurrent is open. In some cases a nonzero Chern number, a topological invariant of the band\nstructure, ensures a finite superfluid mass density. This tantalizing relation between topology and\nsuperfluidity is novel and unexplored. My aim is to characterize superfluidity in lattice systems with flat\nbands that have different symmetries, lattice structures, dimensionality, interparticle interactions\nand possess different topological invariants, in order to provide a general picture of which ones\nare potentially useful as a superconductor with high critical temperature. Whereas mean-field (BCS)\ntheory can provide an essential qualitative understanding and a transparent link to topological properties,\nI plan to use more reliable methods such as Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG)\nin 1D and Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) in 2D and 3D. The ideal platform to test the\ntheoretical predictions are ultracold gases, but I expect to provide useful results also for multiband\nsuperconductors, topological media, carbon-based superconductors, Quantum Hall systems\nand high-Tc superconductors.",
