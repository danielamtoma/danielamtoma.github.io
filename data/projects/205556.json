    "endDate": "31/07/2020",
    "objective": "Ready meal trays made from fossil-based (CPET) plastics are an eminent present and increasing environmental issue. When used, CPET trays have to be incinerated or used as landfill. A fully bio-based and biodegradable alterative with equal to better properties would be a game-changer. \n\nA full value chain will demonstrate the techno-economical viability (including customer satisfaction) of a 100% bio-based and 100% biodegradable alternative made from an innovative cellulose-based composite, using a new lamination technology. The following objectives will be met: at least 10% lighter than fossil alternatives, a radical improved environmental footprint over the product life cycle and more than 80% reduction CO2 emission.\n \nThis action will be executed by: BIC member SË†dra (SWE | resource material), Huhtamaki Molded Fibre Technology (NL | technology provider), Huhtamaki Lurgan (UK |packaging producer) and Samworth as an UK | meal packer (SaladWorks) and a partner for high end UK retailers.\n\nA patented mixture of cellulose and GMO-free PLA called DuraPulp, laminated with a new generation biofilm made from BioPBS, using a novel lamination method are deployed to create the technical properties (low O2 barrier, heat and wet resistance) needed for a high-end ready meal tray. \n\nThis action is a potential game-changer for the: retail, airline catering, meal-services for elderly, and remote operations (civil & military). The economic, environmental and employment impact are  significant.\nA full and powerful value chain, from resource material up-to-consumer, will execute this action in order to gather the evidence needed to decide upon a large-scale commercial market introduction and necessary flagship investment plan.",
