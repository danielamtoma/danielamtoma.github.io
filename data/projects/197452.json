    "objective": "The JET ñ Job market and Employment Transparency ñ project aims to increase job market and employment transparency with a unique tool allowing companies to cross-post their job advertisements all over the Internet (job boards, schools & universities, social networks) and giving them helpful analytics on the outcome of their recruitment strategy. \n\nFor this matter, Multiposting can build on its notable success on the French market: since 2008, its eponymous tool has helped recruiters cross-post more than 20 million job ads on the Internet and the company has become a partner of PÙle Emploi, the French governmental agency for employment. The tool also has helped more than 15,000 recruiters monitor their recruitment strategy so far and the company is producing detailed studies on the French job market for its clients and national competitive clusters.\n\nThe JET project aims to replicate the French success by setting up the product to international standards and bringing Job market and Employment Transparency to the world, beginning with Europe and targeting three pilot markets: Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.",
