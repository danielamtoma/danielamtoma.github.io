    "startDate": "01/08/2017",
    "endDate": "31/01/2018",
    "objective": "This work presents a phase 1 proposal on the development of an innovative propulsion system specifically studied and developed for mini and micro platform. The mini helicon thruster proposed is the outcome of more than ten years of a research started at University of Padua and continued within Technology for propulsion and innovation. The technology has been proven on a relevant environment with thrust measurements showing performances within the target range of mini and micro platforms. After a wide overview of competitors and market perspective it has been realized that this technology may have a disruptive impact on the future space market of small satellites. In this proposal a refinement of the business plan is proposed through the following key activities:  better identification of market requirements by detailed contact with potential customer, deeper evaluation of competitors√≠ strength cross checking their performances with customer needs, identification of supply chain, definition of development plan, suppliers, industrialization plan, risk assessment and contingency plan, development of market plan and IP protection strategy.",
