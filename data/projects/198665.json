    "objective": "This proposal plans to develop simulations of heavy quark phenomenology in 2\\1f QCD with the vacuum effects of up, down and strange quarks simulated directly at physical quark masses. Heavy quarks in the region of the physical charm quark mass will be included in the valence approximation, and for a number of masses, which when combined with extrapolations making use of heavy quark symmetry will facilitate the prediction of the phenomenology and weak interactions of charm and bottom meson systems. All fermions will make use of chirally symmetric fermion formulations, and this will bring particular simplification to the predictive calculation of the weak interaction amplitudes that constrain searches for new physics in experiments such as the LHC.",
