    "objective": "The NATEDE project is a breakthrough indoor air-cleaning technology targeting not just the elimination of indoor air pollution but also the creation of healthy new air thanks to a powerful combination of real plants with technology and design (Clairy solution). The novelty of the NATEDE project is based on the introduction of the forced-air system in the natural air purification arena. It is done through the introduction of a specially designed pot equipped with a fan forcing the air to move through the soil and the roots of the plant by stimulating faster and more effectively the process of elimination of pollution and the process of photosynthesis. Moreover, the NATEDE project introduces a mobile internet functionality (in line with the Internet of Things trend) combined with a set of advanced sensors to the equation, whereby users can operate the Clairy solution through their smartphones and tablets, set automatic start/stop time based on predefined parameters (time, level of air pollution, etc.) and monitor the actual indoor pollution. The proof of concept has already been achieved showing that the Clairy solution can reduce indoor pollution to safe levels already within hours of activity. Consequently, Clairy can be considered as one-of-a-kind solution that gives an ìextra pair of lungsî to plants.",
