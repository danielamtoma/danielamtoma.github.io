    "objective": "The objective of the project is to get a complete set of assembly and maintenance tooling, including auxiliary tooling. Due to the tight tolerances required in aeronautical industry, Some assembly jigs will be equipped with an optical structured light measure system that will allow the set up of the tooling and the position verification of the parts during assembly with tolerances equal or under 0.1 mm. The use of this kind of systems are spearhead in the field of precision measurement and the advantages against currently measurement systems, as laser tracker, will be shown in following paragraphs. In addition, optical systems are becoming the preferred measurement systems in automatized assembly jigs which will be the step forward in the aeronautical assembly lines.",
