    "objective": "The commercialization of existing tunneling accelerometers is hindered by their complex fabrication and long-term instability. Based on our results and expertise from the currently running ERC project, we propose an innovative design using graphene as the game-changing material for tunneling accelerometers.\n\n  The proposed graphene tunneling accelerometer has clear technical advantages, such as smaller size, wider bandwidth, simpler fabrication, and natural stability. A careful patent search indicates that the concept is novel for patent protection. Our industrial contacts have clear interest in this innovation, detailed user requirements on the accelerometer specifications have been recently mapped up. We have a capable team and a feasible plan towards the real-life commercialization of the proof-of-concept innovation. The output of the project is expected to be a long-pursued efficient application of graphene in high-end sensors. Continuity of the development and commercialization is strongly considered also after the project funding.",
