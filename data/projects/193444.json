    "title": "Real-time dynamic control system for laser welding",
    "startDate": "01/02/2015",
    "endDate": "31/10/2018",
    "objective": "RADICLE aims to create a real-time dynamic control system for laser welding using a combination of (application specific) sensors in combination with intelligent and predictive control technologies for in-process monitoring and control to minimize/eliminate defects for a range of materials and geometries for both aerospace, automotive and other applications. The control system will include pre- and post-welding measurement as well as in-process monitoring, control and fault prevention / fixing. The project has 4 large, end-user partners - Rolls-Royce, Alstom, GKN and CRF (FIAT) therefore the impact of RADICLE is expected to be very large.\n\nThe overall impacts of successful implementation of the RADICLE technology through our consortium and the wider welding sectors will enable us to achieve the following impacts:\n- Increased productivity of up to 30%, resulting in:\n          - 30% reduced energy usage;\n          - 30% reduced emissions;\n- Eliminate the need for part scrappage or rework (up to 20%-30% of labour input);\n- Reduction or removal of the need for final NDE testing of the parts;\n- Remove need for large enclosed remote welding rooms (~35% floor space reduction);\n- Increase health and safety benefits;\n\nIn addition, RADICLE will contribute to the wider Europe 2020 targets, through:\n- Increased employment of 20-64 year-olds;\n- Increased R&D spending;\n- Reduced energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions;\n- Increased education, especially at third level education;",
