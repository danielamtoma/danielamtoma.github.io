    "objective": "The overall objective of GiPStechís NAV4I innovation project is to complete the development and start the market deployment of its proprietary technology that will provide the market with the first solution able to locate and navigate indoor with a precision of 1 meter without any requirement of new infrastructure installation. From an industrial stand-point, many are the sectors that need an effective indoor localization. In some sector indoor localization is poised to reduce costs of operations, for example allowing in healthcare to optimize the use of medical devices across a location but also finding lost or ìwonderingî patients in large structures; in logistics to track goods and mobile equipment; in manufacture to locate workers in the event of an accident or disaster. In other sectors indoor localization can open-up new revenue growth opportunities, for example allowing retailers to guide customers in shops and perform proximity marketing; fair organizers to finally provide visitors with a functional tool to navigate their spaces; museums to deliver smart automated guides able to optimize visitors flows.",
