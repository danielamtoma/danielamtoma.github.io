    "objective": "This project aims at optimizing the interface between halide perovskites and different semiconductors through the use of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). Such interface engineering will be applied to perovskite solar cells where SAMs will play the role of ìmolecular gluesî between the active perovskite layer and charge transport layers (n- and p-type metal oxides as well as organic semiconductors). Through the grafting and self-assembly of short bifunctional molecules, PerovSAMs will ensure a smooth and close contact at the interfaces, favouring charge transfer in the cell, thus minimizing losses and enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE). Furthermore, this versatile methodology will also be applied to perovskite nanocrystals (NCs). Surface functionalization of the NCs with SAMs will allow the formation of a perovskite shell with a different chemical composition creating core-shell quantum dots with superior photovoltaic properties, boosting the incipient field of perovskite NC-based solar cells.",
