    "objective": "DOC-FAM is a COFUND Doctoral Programme with a duration of 60 months presented by the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) and coordinated through the Institute of Materials Science of Barcelona (ICMAB). The main aim of the programme is the training of 22 early-stage researchers during 36 months each as the next-generation of scientists in the exciting field of Functional Advanced Materials, while at the same time offering a complete training experience to the recruited fellows. This doctoral programme builds up on the recent award obtained by ICMAB as one of the 22 ìSevero Ochoa Centres of Excellenceî, an award given by the Spanish Government that recognizes institutions from all areas of knowledge that perform cutting-edge research at world standards. The award as ìSevero Ochoa Centre of Excellenceî to develop ìSmart Functional Materials for Social Grand Challengesî (FUNMAT, 2016-2019) demonstrates the outstanding international scientific leadership of ICMAB in the field of Advanced Functional Materials and Nanomaterials. The aim of the research programme offered in DOC-FAM is to complement the training aspects of FUNMAT by offering the recruited fellows an excellence training programme in the bourgeoning field of Functional Advanced Materials through an interdisciplinary, intersectorial and international approach with the support of several partner organisations from the area, four of them contributing to the co-funding of the doctoral programme. The designed training programme combines different types of activities that will enhance their research and personal skills, providing them with new career perspectives.",
