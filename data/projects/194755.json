    "objective": "In recent years an innovative magnetron sputtering technique named high power pulsed/impulse magnetron sputtering (HPPMS/HIPIMS) has emerged. It is characterized by a high degree of ionization of the sputtered material which makes it a very attractive deposition technique for enhancing and tailoring coating properties. Extremely dense, hard, well adherent and smooth coatings are obtained.\nHowever, after fourteen years of developments, the real up-scaling and industrialization of this promising technology has not been achieved. The main problem is the mistaken assumption based just on including new HIPIMS power supplies into conventional sputtering systems.\nThis project aims to develop new HIPIMS deposition equipment capable to control process parameters (magnetic field strength and unbalance and pulsing configuration) in order to demonstrate that process-designed HIPIMS for specific application can result in superior coatings. \nThe target market for the developed coatings is the plastic injection moulding sector where there are high demands on surface quality of moulds. The main degradation mechanisms involved are adhesion, abrasion and corrosion of the surface; moreover, low adhesion of the plastic melt is necessary for reduction of release forces. HIPIMS technology offers outstanding advantages with respect to conventional coating technologies currently applied on moulds (PVD and electroplating) offering optimized performance against corrosion, sticking and wear.\nThis project gives FLUBETECH the opportunity to evaluate the requirements and benefits (both technical and economical) that the launch of an optimized concept of HIPIMS, repetitive and easy to scale-up, will entail for them. Phase 1 of this project will assess the technical feasibility and commercial potential of the breakthrough innovation that Flubetech wants to exploit and commercialize. The outcome of this study will be a detailed business plan.",
