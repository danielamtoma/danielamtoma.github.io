    "objective": "Ostoform is a spin-out medical device company from the University of Limerick, Ireland with a range of patented technologies, and the potential to scale, becoming a global leader in the area of ostomy skin health. There is enormous opportunity to address needs in the ostomy market, with 66% of all ileostomy and urostomy patients suffering from skin complications. The companyís first, award winning product, uses a combination of advanced absorbent and non-absorbent materials to prevent acidic output from contacting the patientís skin. Benefits of this product include healthier skin, better usability, increased patient confidence and improved patient quality of life. Ostoform will release this product in 2018, and major ostomy companies, including B Braun and For Life have already expressed strong interest in distribution.\nThe addressable patient population for Ostoformís first product is approximately 1,000,000 in the EU and US combined, resulting in an annual market of $725m. The device is typically reimbursed by healthcare systems, resulting in a smoother route to market. \nThis feasibility study will be used to further develop a global reimbursement and go-to-market strategy for Ostoformís first product. It will also assist in establishing a final cost of manufacture for the device.",
