    "startDate": "01/04/2015",
    "endDate": "30/09/2015",
    "objective": "The main novelty of Woolvation project is the introduction of an eco-innovative cultivation block for vegetable production in greenhouses that is made from a natural raw material (sheep wool), and being 100% bio-degradable it will have no negative impact on the environment. The introduction of Woolvation blocks means an entirely new application for sheep wool, whose chain-of-use will become 100% sustainable, from farm to farm, or from farm to biogas. The overall Woolvation idea has the ambition to  \n誰\tGive sheep wool a new recovery potential, which will reduce wasted sheep wool to a minimum\n誰\tMinimise the use of rockwool in greenhouses, which become a hazardous waste after use\n誰\tProvide a new soil amending product (mixed with manure or pure) to farmers\n誰\tProvide new feedstock (mixed with manure) for bio-gas plants\nTo achieve that the aim of this Project is to study the feasibility of the Woolvation idea which will include a\na)technical feasibility tests\nb)economic feasibility studies\nc)business plan.",
