    "objective": "Against the background of the ongoing crisis of the worldís food systems, this research project investigates how agricultural knowledge shapes, and is shaped by, its broader cultural, economic, socio-technical and socio-ecological context. A transdisciplinary approach ñtheoretically and empirically explorative, methodologically innovative, and action-orientedóto the production, transmission and application of agricultural knowledge in Belgium, and Europe more broadly, offers a powerful way of thinking about the complex relationships that exist between food systems and agricultural knowledge. \n\nDrawing on insights from a variety of disciplinary perspectives ñranging from political ecology, Science, Technology and Society studies, agroecology and ecofeminismóthis project seeks to: (a) develop an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary ëpolitical agroecologyí framework that broadens and opens up critical discussions on agricultural knowledges; (b) study processes of enclosure and commoning through the study of a science-and-society controversy around the development of genetically engineered potatoes in Belgium to frame agricultural knowledge trajectories; (c) involve ëconcerned groupsí ñincluding farmers, researchers, policy-makers, NGOs and activistsó in the development of strategies and actions for social innovation in agricultural knowledge systems. \n\nThe innovative approach advanced in this research provides a necessary corrective to the prevailing yet partial views of existing approaches to agricultural knowledge systems. By using the lens of ëpolitical agroecologyí, the project engages with the power dynamics inherent in the social interactions which are part of agricultural knowledge, while exploring possibilities for social innovation.\n\nThe project is hosted at a global, interdisciplinary and policy-committed research centre for sustainability and includes a farmersí organisation as a non-academic secondment partner to maximise the impact of the IF.",
