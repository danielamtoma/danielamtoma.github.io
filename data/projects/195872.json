    "objective": "The derivation of macroscopic (effective) equations from microscopic considerations is a long-standing challenge of the mathematical analysis of many-body problems. In this research proposal, we focus on the derivation of (linear or non-linear) kinetic and Hartree-type equations from microscopic quantum models. \nThe innovative and creative potential of the project relies on the combination of rigorous methods of Quantum Field Theory (QFT) and Quantum Statistical Mechanics (QSM).\nParticular attention will indeed be paid to the macroscopic properties of interacting quantum systems governed by a microscopic dynamics. The latter is a notoriously difficult mathematical problem for which only few rigorous results exist. The proposed research will yield significant outcomes in this field, while developing important knowledge transfers, locally between the researchers SÈbastien Breteaux, Jean-Bernard Bru and Miguel Escobedo, and globally between BCAM and TU Braunschweig, the University of Paris Nord, ETH Z¸rich and the University of S„o Paulo",
