    "objective": "Windows and curtain wall profiles are responsible for about 30-50% of the heat loss through typical building envelopes. The material used to produce the frame plays a prominent role not only in terms of energy-efficiency but also regarding the behaviour of the product when expose to fire.\nFIBGLOW project consists in the designing, industrialization and commercialization of fiberglass-based window and curtain wall profiles, which are not extended in the European market. FIBGLOW is the best substitute to current aluminium, wood and PVC materials providing unique thermal insulation values, outstanding mechanical properties, fire-resistance performance, maintenance-free and magnificient durability.\nFIBGLOW will help construction companies and installer to comply with the most stringent regulation  in terms of energy efficiency (Directive 2010/31/EU - Nearly-zero energy buildings by 2020 and 2018 for Public buildings) and fire resistance (Euroclass classification according to CPR EU 305/2011).",
