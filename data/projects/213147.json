    "objective": "We are designing molecular networks - based on DNA programing- to detect extremely dilute molecular signals and robustly separate them from background noise. This could have relevant applications in the field of molecular diagnostics, in particular in the area of ultra-sensitive testing of nucleic acids from liquid biopsy for example for the detection of circulating microRNA. MicroRNA are difficult targets for standard ultra sensitive techniques such as quantitative PCR, but, because of their presence in the blood stream, they also represent an emerging class of important biomarkers for a wide range of diseases, including cancer.  \nThis project will allow us to put together a proof of principle, based of clinically relevant targets and sample, that will clearly demonstrate the benefit of our approach for the molecular diagnostic of microRNA, in terms of sensibility, multiplexing, robustness, modularity and simplicity in sample preparation.",
