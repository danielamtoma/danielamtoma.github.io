    "objective": "Dwarfbody-Therapeutics (DB-Tx) is a new company, established in 2016 as a spin off from a frontrunner research team in Gastro-Intestinal Cancers in the AMC Amsterdam. DB-Tx aims to transform current, ineffective treatment of these aggressive cancer types by co-administering highly effective and safe low molecular weight antibodies (ìDwarfbodiesÆî) to significantly increase therapeutic outcome.  The superiority of the DwarfbodiesÆ compared to competing molecules and their anticancer effects have been published in various high ranked journals. Now PANTREAT primarily aims at broadening the initial target market for the DwarfbodiesÆ by creating additional proof-of-concept, reports on production, test Trial Centers and a sound business plan. Results will be compiled into a sound company portfolio, which will form the basis for further development of the DwarfbodiesÆ and obtaining investments and supportive grants and partnerships. Finally, this will lead to highly attractive licencing deals from 2020 onwards.",
