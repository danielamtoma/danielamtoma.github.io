    "objective": "Several kinds of collision experiments such as the heavy ion programs conducted at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) give access to the study of QCD matter under extreme conditions. In particular, the creation of new states of matter as the deconfined quark-gluon plasma or the color glass condensate, where large densities of gluons can be found, present new opportunities to improve our overall understanding of strong interactions. It is proposed to use the several hard probes generated in these kind of setup (jets, heavy quarks, etc.) to study the properties of such states of matter through the implementation of perturbative techniques.",
