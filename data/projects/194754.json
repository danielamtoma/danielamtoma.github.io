    "objective": "Virtual platforms have been mainly used to support anticipation of embedded software (eSW) development of very complex System on Chip (SoC) or for Software-based functional validation of complex IP. The explosion of the number of connected things change the complexity paradigm: the challenge is now to manage hundreds of distributed platforms (SoCs or boards) that include processors, sensors, MEMs and communication devices.  \n\nUsing physical board to prototype each of these platforms to verify the overall system behaviour is too expensive and not scalable for system providers. System integrators require a scalable solution for system prototyping. The use of virtual platforms appears to be the answer, but they lack tools to deploy and integrate this solution in their prototyping flow. \n \nAccording to state of the art and technical analysis with CEA and Fraunhofer, no such solution is available today; as a long time provider of hardware integration platform, Magillem has been a pioneer in design environment software for SoC integration and SoC virtual platform since its early days and believe to be in a unique position to introduce a very innovative solution for IoT enablement. By using PILoTS, European leading system integrators, as well as suppliers of MEMS, micro-controllers, connected systems would save time and cost, during design, verification and certification, and vastly improve their competitiveness.",
