    "objective": "Thor Biocrude (ThorñNL) and Susteen Technologies (SusteenñD) are taking the next step in the development and roll-out of a novel and low-cost biomass waste-to-fuel technology platform called Thermal Catalytic Reforming (TCR). TCR is a biomass conversion technology that converts low value wet organics bio-waste into high value biocrude (TCR-oil), green hydrogen-rich bio-syngas, and solid bio-char, that can be processed to biofuels and biochemicals. In a preliminary project, the Thermal Catalytic Reforming (TCR) technology has been validated for 3 different municipal waste feedstocks: OWF (organic wet fraction of municipal solid waste), DIG (digestate from OWF) and PSS (primary sewage sludge). The TCR validation tests have shown proof of technology and economy, and all 3 feedstocks have been successfully converted from organic waste into valuable TCR components. Objectives of this Phase 1 proposal are to (1) explore new bio-based value chains, utilizing relevant bio-waste fractions for bio-product generation, and (2) elaborate a detailed business plan, including the assessment of the potential impact of the proposed value chains.",
