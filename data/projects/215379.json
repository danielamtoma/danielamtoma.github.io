    "objective": "Breast cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related death in women all over the world. Although therapeutic approach like surgery, chemotherapy, radiation and targeted therapy reduced the risk of cancer specific mortality. Still there is a risk of cancer recurrence and mortality. \nCancer research is typically dependent on 2D system and animal model which leads to conflicting the result due to cellular behavior, phenotypes, gene expression level and expensive animal studies (Szot et al., 2011). In this way 3D microfluidics systems are designed to fulfill the gap between 2D and animal model for screening and testing of drug. The present proposal is conceptualize to bridge the gap between 2D and animal model effectively, by designing the Organs-on-chip (3D), microfluidics system of tumor microenvironment to evaluate the efficacy of combination of anticancerous drug. Herein, the multi-compartment microfluidics platform will be generated by co-culturing of cancer cells, fibroblast and endothelial cells into biocompatible hydrogel, to produce a multi-organ-on-a-chip devices. It recapitulates organ-like functions in each compartment and a vascular-channel between the compartments produce preliminary human on-chip. This 3D microfluidics system dedicated to evaluate the efficacy of anticancerous drug will be helpful to improve the future drug development applications.",
