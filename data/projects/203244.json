    "objective": "Are financial markets informationally efficient? Are some economic agents more informed than others? What is the impact of such heterogeneity on asset prices? These questions, of great economic significance, have permeated academic and business circles over the last few decades. Despite significant progress on the theoretical and empirical fronts relatively little is known about how information is endogenously acquired and processed in markets by agents with differential access to information and facing heterogeneous opportunities.\n\nUsing the novel setting of endogenous information acquisition with non-trivial heterogeneity the project has two goals: (A) to lay out micro foundations for informed trading in investment and corporate settings using the contexts of illegal insider trading and household finance; (B) to investigate macro implications of heterogeneous information for global economic phenomena such as income inequality, organizational design, and market power.",
