    "objective": "The project aims is focused on the design and manufacture of a novel air-oil engine cooling system to be integrated into the engine bay.  The project will investigate any better configurations to achieve the same heat rejection with lower weight and smaller overall dimensions than conventional ACOC systems.  In addition, improved integration into the engine system (without impairing cooler efficiency) will be designed through the use numerical simulations via Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to assess the hydraulic, structural and aerodynamic impact of the ACOC installation.  In addition to this an assessment of the heat management for the engine system will be required using 1D AMESIM simulation leading to a proposed heat management model and finally demonstrator hardware will be delivered for engine ground tests.",
