    "objective": "DiverseJust takes a novel approach to studying Denmarkís contentious policy debate on welfare and the criminal justice\nsystem in times of increased immigration and cultural diversity. Most current research focuses on either welfare or the\ncriminal justice system, as theoretically separate entities. However, following Loic Wacquantís work, this project examines policy changes in welfare and the criminal justice system, examining them as a compound of intimately connected policies \nthat evolve in tandem in response to increased diversity in welfare states. I argue that to fully understand the evolution of\nwelfare and criminal justice systems, we need to consider race and ethnicity as central variables that shape state response\nto deviance and poverty. Using expert interviews, the research project will explore (a) the impact that increased diversity has on the Danish welfare system, especially for immigrants; and (b) the impact that increased diversity has on the Danish criminal justice system. Ultimately, this study asks (c) how Denmark, a classic Scandinavian welfare state, may change in response to the challenges of increased cultural diversity.",
