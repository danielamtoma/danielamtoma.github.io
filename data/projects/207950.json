    "objective": "BlueAquality will improve EU aquaculture, making it more competitive and more effective by providing an ìIndustry-Wide-Computingî metasystem to help fish farmers, other aquaculturists, and all other players in the aquaculture-web (e.g. suppliers of feed, equipment, logistics, consultancy, veterinary-services and medicines, the processing industry, wholesalers and consumers; public authorities, universities, and NGOís). These constitute tens of thousands of SMEís and many larger organisations. BlueAquality will provide added value at an affordable price, giving increased and more efficient production with reduced environmental impact, enhanced transparency, improved information flow to consumers, better adaptation to market trends, reduced administration burdens, improved information-exchange to/from authorities and other stakeholders.\n\nThis Phase 1 feasibility study will determine the optimum market approach for success. This will include market assessment and appraisal of which partners should be included in phase 2 in order to achieve a meta-system with the best and broadest possible coverage, thus ensuring the best impact.",
