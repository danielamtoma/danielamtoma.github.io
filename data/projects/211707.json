    "objective": "Lead Acid Batteries (LABs) are a vital and widely-used technology. The global LAB market is expected to grow by 59% to Ä71.6 billion by 2022 with Europe accounting for the second largest market share. Waste LAB recycling rates are as high as 95% in Europe, but the current recycling process ñ smelting waste LABs in a furnace ñ consumes vast quantities of energy, is highly polluting, wasteful, large scale and expensive. Furthermore, smelted lead must be further processed to produce the essential LAB ingredient: the active lead oxide paste. A new lead recycling process is needed that is energy efficient, non-polluting, low cost, scalable and produces LAB-ready lead products. Such process would meet EC priorities by addressing resource efficiency, the sustainable supply of raw materials and drive the circular economy. AEL has developed a novel hydrometallurgical process technology to recycle waste LABs in a highly energy efficient, non-polluting and cost effective way. NUOVOpbís commercial appeal lies in its low cost and scalability, and our ground-breaking ability to produce LAB-ready products that exceed the performance of current products on the market. Our LAB-ready paste can create new LABs with 22% greater energy capacity and 50% longer life.  The technology has the potential to transform the global battery recycling industry, which has an expected value of Ä9.5 billion in 2024. 5 years post project, we expect to be operating 18 NUOVOpb facilities across the world. These will be processing 490,000 tonnes of waste LABs (6% of the global waste LAB market) and avoiding 196,000 tonnes CO2 emissions every year. In doing so, AEL will secure annual revenues of Ä206 million, profits of Ä54 million, and will have created 200 jobs within AEL.  NUOVOpb is the most complete closed-loop recycling system in the world, providing significant commercial opportunities for businesses in both the LAB recycling and LAB manufacturing supply chain, globally.",
