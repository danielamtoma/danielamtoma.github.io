    "objective": "The main goal of this project is the development of an industrial ìplug & playî system for additive layer manufacturing which is based on a blown powder process using Plasma Transferred Arc (PTA) Technology. The developed 4M System will offer:\na)\tSimple equipment concept based on well established PTA technology for hard facing coatings\nb)\tPossibility to realize Multi-Material concepts\nc)\tSuitability of the technology to be used for a wide range of raw materials \nd)\tHigh deposition/building rates\ne)\tPossibility to realize large size components (up to 1,5 m x 1,5 m in the first version)\nWithin the project the system will be developed to be used for wo different materials (Al and Ti-alloys) and to demonstrate one multi-material concept. The developed process will be used to realize three different demonstrators (case studies) and to perform testing of the manufactured prototypes under space relevant testing conditions.",
