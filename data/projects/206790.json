    "objective": "OWANDBO is a collaborative platform that empowers individuals towards more participative and open exchange of resources; reduces carbon footprint by sharing assets; expands the life cycle of a product and reduces waste. OWANDBO allows members to rent and share the resources that they own and do not use enabling them, Owners and Borrowers, to benefit from a mutual economic transaction. OWANDBO's potential could achieve over 10 million renting transactions between members throughout the world in five years, saving over 10,000 tonnes of waste and generating value for members, the governments and partners associated. Currently there are no digital platforms like OWANDBO that allow peers to connect and share their underutilized goods and assets in a convenient, accessible, user-friendly and profitable way. The market potential for the sharing economy in Europe is Ã„572 billion. In France alone while 19% of consumers reported use of this type in 2013, twice as many considered it in 2014, and 60% in 2015. However the big picture of the business opportunity for Buzinger with the OWANDBO project includes also environmental benefits and creation of governmental wealth through taxation on transactions, increased quality of goods exchanged, fostering local production and empowering individuals with new revenues. At Buzinger we have identified a great business opportunity within main cities in Europe and the US for a reliable Platform (OWANDBO) that assures users that assets will be available when needed and guarantees owners that their possessions will be treated appropriately and returned in the same conditions as before renting them. In five years time OWANDBO will be at the same level of other digital platforms, Airbnb, BlaBlaCar, within the Sharing Economy.",
