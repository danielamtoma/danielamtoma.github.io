    "objective": "Botteega is a platform that makes it easy to do grocery shopping from traditional city markets, local shops and artisanal producers, through a network of ìNeighborhood Shoppersî that take care of orders pick-up and delivery in 1- 3 hours.\nBotteega will be proposed also as a complete solution to local goverment bodies that aim to increase e-commerce adoption by city markets and shops. For a one-time setup fee, we will offer a 1-stop-shop service which includes the creation of a products catalogue with pictures and descriptions; a training program for sellers and same-day delivery through a fleet of Neighbourhood Shoppers. Even small villages in turistic areas will be able to sell online with local/national/international delivery.",
