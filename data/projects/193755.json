    "objective": "In this ERC PoC project, materials and methods developed in ìPrinted Electroceramics with Ultimate Compositionsî will be utilised to demonstrate the feasibility of dielectric ultra-low temperature ceramics as basic electrical components realised on polymer, metal foil and paper substrates. The aims are to realise a set of capacitors and microwave antennae utilising high permittivity ceramic coatings as integral structures (without gluing, adhesives, etc. of discrete components) of aforementioned 3D substrates. In addition, the IPR strategy will be created and potential markets analysed for these components.",
