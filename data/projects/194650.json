    "objective": "Objective of this project is the implementation, validation and demonstration up to the commercial phase of an innovative and flexible device mounted on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), named in the following TherVIS. The device is suitable for: i) mapping energy building performance for energy saving within large extent areas (e.g. building blocks, districts, small communities), ii) evaluating structural health of civilian infrastructures (including bridges, new, old and historical buildings, pipelines, etc.) for public security.\nThe age of existing buildings is rising and, as a result, they continuously undergo degradation. The improvement of the energy consumption efficiency of buildings and their environmental impacts is a general issue of increasing importance for the construction industry in Europe and all over the world.\nFor minimizing energy losses TherVIS device is proposed, consisting in a monitoring device integrating a new generation thermal camera coupled with a stereo camera or laser scanning. The monitoring system is mounted on a micro-UAV equipped with different navigation sensors, stabilized by a microcontroller-based flight control and basically operated by GPS navigation or manual remote control. An innovative methodology would be implemented allowing the 3D aerial pictures and thermal images, acquired at a high sensitivity rate, high speed and low frequency, to be automatically integrated in a combined 3D spatial-thermal image within a purposely-built model. Using in situ measured meteorological conditions, the model would allow for quantification of local energy losses and for detection of structural damages of the building. This approach would lead, within large extent areas (e.g. building blocks, districts, small communities) and with a limited number of images (i.e. low operating costs), to: i) an automatic cracking pattern recognition and to ii) a smart 3D spatial-thermal mapping for energy performance assessment.",
