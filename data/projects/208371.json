    "objective": "Given the poor regenerative potential of the adult heart after heart failure (HF), therapies capable of contributing for cardioprotection and cardio-regeneration are of great need. Recent advances in pharmacologic therapy and stem cells are currently not enough to address HF. The hypothesis of this project is that exosomes, nanovesicles secreted by cells may be a potential therapy for HF. Exosomes may offer advantages relatively to cell-based therapies regarding efficacy (does not require engraftment and survival), processing and cost. The main objective of the current project is to develop an effective strategy to deliver exosomes by intravenous (IV) injection into the heart (targeting) and to maximize exosome regenerative potential (bioactivity). Therefore, the project aims to develop a non-cellular-based therapy to regenerate the heart after infarction based on the targeted delivery of exosomes. Undertaking this research along with formal training and mentoring will enhance my academic profile, scientific experience, and content expertise in nanobiotechnology, to enable me to develop into an independent, leading researcher. The proposed research contributes to the EU priority of addressing the societal challenge of improving lifelong health and wellbeing of all.",
