The SprayPrinter team is currently developing an innovative wireless printer device which communicates with any smartphone camera through an app that controls the painting process. The device itself attaches to an aerosol spray can, allowing the design to be directly  spray printed onto any wall surface. This spray printing technology is unrivalled on the marketplace today and will serve the needs of numerous target groups and end-users, including both existing artists and home users. The product falls in line with the do-it-yourself and maker trends that have been gaining traction globally and not only outperforms many of the larger competitors in terms of affordable, customizable wall art solutions but also offers a unique alternative to the more traditional means of interior decoration. Phase 1 activities are designed for verifying the technological and commercial feasibility of the innovative device and serve as input into elaborating the underlying innovation project.",
