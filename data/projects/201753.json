The kits are versatile, with a cartridge-based reagent to identify and concentrate allergens for detection, and an accurate reader that can provide quantitative readouts for industrial users or a simple ìtraffic lightî system for consumer model users. Results are available in 10 seconds or less, a reader can be used for over 10,000 tests, and test strips are simple to use, with a low cost.",
