    "objective": "The project will enhance Estonian research potential and capacities in translational medicine with particular focus on immunological diseases and neurological disorders, which represent a challenging burden on individuals and healthcare systems worldwide. Strategic partnership with UCL and KI - both international leaders in medical research and education, enables developing long-lasting knowledge exchange framework for allowing University of Tartu (UT) to capitalise on its current achievements and deliver a new internationally-leading European Centre of Translational Medicine (CETM).\n\nThe specific objectives of the project are to:\n1. measurably and significantly enhance the overall scientific R&I capacity of UT and Estonia in the field of translational medicine\n2. raise the research profile of academic staff\n3. strengthen UT짜s networking capacity, visibility and credibility\n\nIn order to achieve these objectives, the twinning activities with UCL and KI will:\n- create a strategic framework for sustainable development (long-term development plan, links with industrial partners, public funding and investment strategy, IPR strategy)\n- enhance UT짜s research capacity in 6 key areas/techniques (6 joint summer schools/seminars, 11 medium-term visits, 38 short bidirectional visits, participation in conferences)\n- develop transferable skills of UT짜s research staff (training seminars in networking/H2020 participating, IPR, research commercialisation, ethics, communication skills and doctoral training)\n- extend UT짜s strategic partnerships and visibility among the professional community, industry, policy-makers and public (strategic networking, publications, science days, open workshops, targeted stakeholders)\n\nAs the expected result of the CETM-TWIN project, the twinning activities between the consortium will lead to research improving synergy that supports building one of the leading translational medicine competency centres in the North-Eastern European region by 2020.",
