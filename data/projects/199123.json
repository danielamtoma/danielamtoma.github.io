    "objective": "The last twenty years has seen a huge improvement in the quality of images produced by commercial visual display units. Nevertheless, they still do not fully recreate the range of sensations we experience during natural vision. We have designed a prototype visual display that will allow us to take advantage of recent developments in visual neurophysiology to address that limitation. We request funds to construct this prototype and explore its performance as a necessary proof of concept for its commercialisation.",
