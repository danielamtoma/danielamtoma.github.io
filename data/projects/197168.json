    "objective": "FIORDELISI, leader in the production of dehydrated vegetables in Italy and the first in the production of sun-dried and semi-dried tomatoes was created on 1960. Around 3,500,000 square meters of fields cultivated under Fiordelisi√≠s careful supervision and an annual production capacity 1,200 tons of sun-dried tomatoes, 700 tons of semi-dried tomatoes, 200 tons of artichokes and 500 tons of other vegetables show our business development. In order to offer always high quality food products, we start by a targeted seed selection and we use modern processes of sanitation and storage, which are constantly studied and improved. \nNow, we have developed SHOCKO3: a novel sanitation and preservation process based on ozone and a thermal shock. We envisage that SHOCKO3 will replace all traditional oil and freezing based conservation methods. SHOCKO3 will offer approx. 35% of weight reduction, 20% transportation energy saving, 30% CO2 emission reduction, 35% reduction of raw material (oil method replacement), 15% increase average of organoleptic properties (20% taste, 5% colour and % 15 odour) with shelf-life up to 5 months.",
