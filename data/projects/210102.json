    "objective": "SSOP is a profitable green technology that transforms 95% of the solids of sewage sludge into fuel (oil \\ gas \\ char) and reduces the disposed sludge volume down to 5%. SSOP minimizes the environmental impact and disposal costs of the sludge and valorises this residue transforming it into a fully renewable source of energy (bio-crude). The users of SSOP (municipal WWTPs) will reduce their sludge treatment costs 75% (current annual operation expenses for SSOP are Ä 1 million for a 15,000 population equivalent/year plant whilst they are around Ä 4 million for conventional sludge disposal methods). Furthermore, the energy obtained will plenty cover the energy requirements of the plant (10%-30% of operation costs), leading to a global 50 % increase in profit thanks to savings. Our technology will also open a new business line for increasing profit: selling bio-crude.",
