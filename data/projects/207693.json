    "objective": "C2B is a novel microbially-mediated process that captures large amounts of CO2 from industrial plants and converts it into biofuels and chemicals. C2B process is based on Oakbioís proprietary microbial strain, which uses CO2 from any flue gas and hydrogen (H2) as a feedstock to produce n-butanol, a valuable drop-in biofuel. In fact, n-butanol is primarily used to make durable acrylic plastics, but is also a superior biofuel, which addresses a massive market as a potential gasoline replacement. Oakbioís microbial strain grows in a standard fermenter that can be located next to the flue stack of the factories (cement plants, power plants and refineries). It can capture flue gas directly at the point source with minimal retrofitting. This will allow such factories to cut 70% of their direct GHG emissions, while the n-butanol production adds a significant revenue stream to their bottom line: Oakbio estimates a return of more than Ä25 per t/CO2 captured.",
