    "startDate": "01/07/2016",
    "endDate": "30/09/2017",
    "objective": "Chiral ?-aminobutyric acids (GABAs) represent abundantly prescribed drugs, which are broadly applied as anticonvulsants, antidepressants and for the treatment of neuropathic pain. With the incorporation of more population to western-based style in the coming decades, there is a need of developing and producing pharmaceutically active GABAs and similar (or generic) drugs for higher number of consumers. Supported by an ERC starting grant, Prof. Poelarends has developed an efficient, enzyme-based procedure for the enantioselective synthesis of a wide variety of GABAs. The PoC grant will allow Prof. Poelarends to identify those opportunities in the huge pharmaceutical/generics market where his novel synthesis procedure for pharmaceutically active GABAs provides unique advantages over existing industrial synthesis strategies, in terms of performance, sustainability and economics. To enable the next step towards commercialization, a strong and commercially attractive IP position will be built and a portfolio will be assembled in which the performance of the new technology is compared to current industrial production strategies using extensive market research and demonstration studies. Ultimately, the hope is to license our technology to existing pharmaceutical/generics companies.",
