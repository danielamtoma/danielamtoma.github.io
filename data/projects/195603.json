    "objective": "The first objective of this proposal is to provide a solution to a well recognized problem in 18F-radiochemistry: the direct [18F]fluorination of trifluoromethylated and perfluorinated (CF2-CF3) alkyl chains. We propose to investigate a copper-mediated fluorination of alkyl boronic species using [18F]fluoride. The value of this new radiochemistry will be challenged with the synthesis and the labelling of two well-known and promising biomarkers for hypoxia, EF3 and EF5. We propose to develop an automated protocol for the production of their radiolabelled counterparts, and to perform a pre-clinical comparative study of [18F]EF3 and [18F]EF5 with [18F]FMISO, the current hypoxia biomarker used for PET imaging.",
