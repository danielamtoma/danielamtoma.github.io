    "objective": "The BiOp-FibEnd project aims to develop a functional optical fiber for in-vivo examination of suspect tissues. The information obtained is equivalent to that of a biopsy without removing samples from the living body. The main contribution of this technique is to detect earlier, without bringing distress and discomfort to the patient, diseases such as cancer, coronary obstructions, and many others. To this purpose a hyper-lens providing super-resolved imaging in the mid-IR, mid-IR spectroscopy and optical coherence tomography (OCT) will be combined. A fiber endoscope, ready for in-vivo tests, able to observe and get spectroscopy information of living tissues will be realized.",
