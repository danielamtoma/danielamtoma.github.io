    "objective": "CTFF is a major interdisciplinary project that combines wisdoms in three academic disciplines: Heat Transfer, Fluid Physics and Plasma Physics, to address the research problem on both active and passive control of turbulent friction force. The main focus is on developing techniques for the control of near-wall turbulent structures and the reduction of turbulent friction force, specifically at conditions relevant to engineering practices, by coordinating the efforts of European, the US and Chinese experts specialized in these three different but overlapping domains. New materials will be examined, novel numerical algorithms will be developed, and the numerical results will be tested in physical experiments. In brief, the main objective of this project is to coordinate the action of a group of Universities and enterprises, with complementary expertise in three disciplines from European countries, China and the US, to build and test an optimal solution for the reduction of turbulent friction drag, thereby facilitating the successful implementation of friction force control in engineering practices.",
