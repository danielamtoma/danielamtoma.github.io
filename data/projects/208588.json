    "objective": "This project focuses on the self-limited self-assembly of nanocrystals that involves inorganic particles assembling into highly ordered terminal structures. The design of such structures is still challenging but offers many perspectives for templating assemblies of desired shape and size, and for several applications ranging from optoelectronics to energy storage and biosensing. In this scope, the objectives of the proposal are structured around three main stages: (i) the chemical design of uniformly sized, hybrid magnetic/non-magnetic systems, (ii) the monitoring of the self-assembly reaction in situ using real-time measurement techniques, and (iii) the characterization of the effect of an applied external field on the morphology of the assembled structures. The chemical design methodology of the self-limiting complex particles will be investigated along with Prof. Nicholas Kotov (University of Michigan, USA) during the outgoing phase. X-ray scattering/imaging experiments yielding high spatiotemporal resolution will be performed in large-scale synchrotron facilities in the USA as well as in Europe during the return phase along with Prof. Andrei Petukhov (Utrecht University, Netherlands) with whom the effect of an applied magnetic field will be further studied. A collaboration between the two host institutes in Europe and USA will take place through this fellowship and will involve the competences of the three parties: in chemical engineering of hierarchical assemblies in solution (Prof. Kotov), in X-ray scattering/imaging for studying the self-organization of colloids (Prof. Petukhov) and in data analysis/modeling and X-ray scattering (the fellow Law-Hine). The project should bring new insights into the mechanisms of formation of self-limiting, multifunctional nanoparticles and provide strategies for designing these particles using external control fields.",
