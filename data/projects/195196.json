    "objective": "The present project aims at analysing the morpho-syntactical  features of the Luwian language working on the available texts and combining a standard linguistic analysis with the implementation of a statistical analysis of the annotated corpus. By glossing the morpho-syntactical structure of a large selection of both cuneiform and hieroglyphic inscriptions using a protocol derived from and compatible with the Penn Treebank Project and the Leiden Glossing Rules, the research will proceed by isolating, mapping and modelling the regular as well as the anomalous features of the morpho-syntax of one of the most important and still largely unexplored languages of the ancient Anatolian branch of Indo-European. The analysis will also identify and focus on the co-dependant syntactical, morphological, semantic and stylistic phenomena present in the corpus (e.g. syntactic triggering of stylistic features, dislocations, topicalisations). The results of the present research will provide the world of the Indo-European studies with the first comprehensive study ever dedicated to morpho-syntax of the Luwian language.",
