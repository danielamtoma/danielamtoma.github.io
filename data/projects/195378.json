    "objective": "The project contextually sets up a novel framework to study the spectral-theoretical properties of classes of non-selfadjoint (NSA) operators related to Markov processes (MP) via their intertwining to a continuous path selfadjoint (SA) MP. Conceptually, this means that the jumps of each class of NSA MP can be considered a perturbation of one SA MP realized by an intertwining kernel. This approach can have far-reaching consequences for understanding classes of MP as the reduction to SA MP leads to well-studied objects whereas the spectral theory of NSA operators is far from understood. The price of that is the non-invertability of the intertwining kernels. This framework is explored and crystallized by a challenging, detailed spectral-theoretical study of an enormous class of NSA operators directly arising from the key phenomenon of self-similarity and in duality from branching. This is achieved by a synergy of research fields complementing each other to obtain the spectral properties of those operators culminating in the derivation of spectral expansions of the generated semigroups. As a result of this synergy, a number of tools and techniques with impact, including applications to fields beyond the scope of the project, are derived. A particular development in the area of recurrent equations and special functions will be unexpectedly exploited to the effect of a comprehensive theoretical and applied study, including numerical schemes, of key quantities in financial and insurance mathematics such as Asian options and perpetuities. A training-through-research in line with the fellow√≠s affiliation to the host institution and the proposed secondment will critically contribute to the optimal completion of the proposal in terms of time, scope and quality.",
