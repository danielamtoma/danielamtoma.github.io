    "objective": "Onomondo (form. Hello World Mobile) has created a unique telecom software technology to combine mobile networks across carriers and/or across borders, offering a complete seamless roaming free experience for the end user. We simply remove roaming on network level completely (and not just roaming charges). Our aim is strictly B2B, and our potential customers could be Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) and Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs).\nToday the first part of the solution is being live tested together with telecom operators (MNOs) at network level in Scandinavia.\nTHIS PROJECT aims to investigate the market opportunities for the platform technology in order to investigate the opportunity of developing a new technology product.\nThe project will result in a technology roadmap of how the technology can be developed into a license product aimed at the (through the project) identified new target groups, together with a comprehensive market analysis and go to market strategy.",
