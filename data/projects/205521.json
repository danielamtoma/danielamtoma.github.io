    "startDate": "01/10/2016",
    "endDate": "30/09/2018",
    "objective": "With the five broad application areas of the BBI JU Scientific Innovation and Research Agenda, which defines the key areas around which projects should be developed, at its core, the BIOWAYS action will develop excellent promotional and educational materials and design and implement pubic engagement activities, based on this material. These activities will be focused on promoting bio-based industries and the huge potential of their products. BIOWAYS intends to meet the need for better communication of bio-based products and applications and the benefits they bring. In order to attain this ambitious challenge, the BIOWAYS Consortium proposes providing a wide range of integrated, high-level activities and tools with recognised added value for communication programmes, having EU Citizens as their main target. Tools being developed to achieve this include an innovative online collaboration platform and social network, an accessible library of bio-based products, the development of training materials, social hack days, co-creation workshops, an eConference, BarCamps and thematic Charettes.",
