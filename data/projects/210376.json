    "objective": "Sunlight is abundant and free for all. However, the Sun doesn't always shine in the right place at the right time. For example, many big indoor spaces like office blocks and warehouses rely exclusively on artificial lighting as light-source even during daytime. Therefore, bringing solar light where it doesn't reach can be very useful and convenient. SL enables solar light to be transmitted indoors to areas currently void from sufficient sunlight. SOLIS is an innovative, practical and effective lighting system that maximize collection of sunlight from the outside of the buildings (on rooftops or southern walls) and distributes it effectively indoors. Thus, energy is saved in two different ways: by reducing the electrical load required for artificial lighting and by lowering the heat emitted by the lighting , (thereby reducing cooling costs). The SOLIS light dispersing unit is a patent pending dual source lamp, that switches from sunlight to LED. During the day, SOLIS lights interiors using free, natural light.\nAs the sun starts to set and light levels fall, energy-efficient LEDs activate automatically to provide illumination for early morning and evening use. The result is a solar lighting solution that significantly cuts energy costs and improve light quality.",
