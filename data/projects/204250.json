    "objective": "Despite incentives for their use (e.g. renovation grants in Ireland and the UK, preferential low-interest loans in France and Germany), and their increasing adoption by SMEís, renewable energy sources fail to properly meet the demands of their users. In turn, they fail to effectively reduce demand on fossil fuels and public grids. For solar energy, this is due to an inherent mismatch between the solar peak, in the middle of the day, and the energy demand peaks placed on grids in the mornings and evenings; wind energy suffers from instability due to factors like low or inconsistent wind speeds. TEES makes use of compressed fluid and pumped-heat technology to store energy generated by renewable resources and return it on demand at an efficiency of over 85%. TEES also attends to the challenges of providing a robust electricity grid to communities with unstable grids, or large population centres where demand is beginning to exceed national gridsí ability to provide a stable supply of electrical power.",
