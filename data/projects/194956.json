    "objective": "Around 20% of all modern drugs are fluorinated organic molecules. During the recent years, however, pharmaceutical companies struggle to deliver novel drugs to the market, because of the lack of innovative practical reagents and reactions towards ìdrug-likeî compounds. \n   In this project, we will address this issue by discovering novel small fluorinating reagents - fluorinated diazoalkanes, - elaborate their practical reactions, and use this knowledge to develop alternative synthetic approaches to some known drugs (AS-136A, Celecoxib).",
