    "objective": "Fish Flow Innovations (FFI) wants to commercialize a fish friendly tidal stream turbine that converts ocean currents into electricity. The turbine can be fixed mounted on a seabed,  tethered/moored to a seabed and/or buoyant, or float on the water surface or in mid water. \n\nThe turbine is designed and constructed to survive in the harsh conditions offshore, and able to efficiently produce electricity in water flows between 3 and 15 m/s without the need for pitch adjustable blades for bi-directional functionality. The turbine has an integrated gravity based support structure, avoiding the need for expensive underwater support structures. The turbine can be deployed in all planned tidal locations worldwide. \n\nThe main objective of the innovation project is to demonstrate and reach market readiness (TRL 9). At the end of the project (January 2019) through certification and an output performance warranty, a commercially viable levelized Cost of Energy of 10 c√Ñ/kWh will have been demonstrated in real-sea conditions (provided in the Tidal Technology Center Grevelingendam  in The Netherlands).",
